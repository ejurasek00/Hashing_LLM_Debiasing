To find all frequent itemsets with a minimal support of 2 and length 1,
we'll manually count how often each item (value) appears in the dataset
and include those that appear at least twice.


      Dataset


|name        legs count  diet      blood  body hair  eggs   breastfeeding
rabbit      4           herbivore hot    yes        false  indeed
human       2           omnivore  hot    yes        false  indeed
fox         4           omnivore  hot    yes        false  indeed
platypus    4           carnivore hot    yes        true   indeed
|


      Counting Frequencies:

  *

    *legs count:*

      o 4 → appears 3 times (rabbit, fox, platypus)
      o 2 → appears 1 time (human)
  *

    *diet:*

      o herbivore → appears 1 time (rabbit)
      o omnivore → appears 2 times (human, fox)
      o carnivore → appears 1 time (platypus)
  *

    *blood:*

      o hot → appears 4 times (all animals)
  *

    *body hair:*

      o yes → appears 4 times (all animals)
  *

    *eggs:*

      o false → appears 3 times (rabbit, human, fox)
      o true → appears 1 time (platypus)
  *

    *breastfeeding:*

      o indeed → appears 4 times (all animals)


      Frequent Itemsets with Minimal Support of 2 and Length 1:

We now collect the items that appear at least twice:



|set_length1 = {"4", "omnivore", "hot", "yes", "false", "indeed"}
|

These itemsets have a support of at least 2 and a length of 1.

To find all frequent itemsets with a minimal support of 2 and length 2,
we need to look at combinations of items (each of length 2) and count
how many times each combination appears in the dataset. Only those
combinations that appear at least twice will be included.

      Possible Combinations of Length 5:

 1.

    *(legs count, diet, blood, body hair, eggs):*

      * (4, herbivore, hot, yes, false) → 1 time (rabbit)
      * (4, omnivore, hot, yes, false) → 1 time (fox)
      * (4, carnivore, hot, yes, true) → 1 time (platypus)
      * (2, omnivore, hot, yes, false) → 1 time (human)

    No combination appears more than once.

 2.

    *(legs count, diet, blood, body hair, breastfeeding):*

      * (4, herbivore, hot, yes, indeed) → 1 time (rabbit)
      * (4, omnivore, hot, yes, indeed) → 1 time (fox)
      * (4, carnivore, hot, yes, indeed) → 1 time (platypus)
      * (2, omnivore, hot, yes, indeed) → 1 time (human)

    No combination appears more than once.

 3.

    *(legs count, diet, blood, eggs, breastfeeding):*

      * (4, herbivore, hot, false, indeed) → 1 time (rabbit)
      * (4, omnivore, hot, false, indeed) → 1 time (fox)
      * (4, carnivore, hot, true, indeed) → 1 time (platypus)
      * (2, omnivore, hot, false, indeed) → 1 time (human)

    No combination appears more than once.

 4.

    *(legs count, diet, body hair, eggs, breastfeeding):*

      * (4, herbivore, yes, false, indeed) → 1 time (rabbit)
      * (4, omnivore, yes, false, indeed) → 1 time (fox)
      * (4, carnivore, yes, true, indeed) → 1 time (platypus)
      * (2, omnivore, yes, false, indeed) → 1 time (human)

    No combination appears more than once.

 5.

    *(legs count, blood, body hair, eggs, breastfeeding):*

      * (4, hot, yes, false, indeed) → 2 times (rabbit, fox)
      * (4, hot, yes, true, indeed) → 1 time (platypus)
      * (2, hot, yes, false, indeed) → 1 time (human)

    Only (4, hot, yes, false, indeed) appears at least twice.

 6.

    *(diet, blood, body hair, eggs, breastfeeding):*

      * (herbivore, hot, yes, false, indeed) → 1 time (rabbit)
      * (omnivore, hot, yes, false, indeed) → 2 times (human, fox)
      * (carnivore, hot, yes, true, indeed) → 1 time (platypus)

    Only (omnivore, hot, yes, false, indeed) appears at least twice.
