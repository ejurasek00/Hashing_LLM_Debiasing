To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length
1, we need to count the occurrences of each unique item in each column
of the CSV file. Then, we can identify the itemsets that appear at least
twice.

Let's go through each column and count the items:


      Column: "name"

  * rabbit: 1 time
  * human: 1 time
  * fox: 1 time
  * platypus: 1 time

None of these items appear at least twice, so no frequent itemsets here.


      Column: "legs count"

  * 4: 3 times (rabbit, fox, platypus)
  * 2: 1 time (human)

Frequent itemset: |{'4'}|


      Column: "diet"

  * herbivore: 1 time (rabbit)
  * omnivore: 2 times (human, fox)
  * carnivore: 1 time (platypus)

Frequent itemset: |{'omnivore'}|


      Column: "blood"

  * hot: 4 times (rabbit, human, fox, platypus)

Frequent itemset: |{'hot'}|


      Column: "body hair"

  * yes: 4 times (rabbit, human, fox, platypus)

Frequent itemset: |{'yes'}|


      Column: "eggs"

  * false: 3 times (rabbit, human, fox)
  * true: 1 time (platypus)

Frequent itemset: |{'false'}|


      Column: "breastfeeding"

  * indeed: 4 times (rabbit, human, fox, platypus)

Frequent itemset: |{'indeed'}|

Now, let's compile the frequent itemsets with minimal support of 2:



|set_length1 = {{"4"},{"omnivore"},{"hot"},{"yes"},{"false"},{"indeed"}}
|

These are the itemsets with length 1 that appear at least twice in the
dataset.

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length
2, we need to consider pairs of items from different columns and count
how many times each pair appears together in the dataset. Let's go
through the possible combinations:


      Pairs Involving "legs count" = 4:

  * *4, herbivore:* Appears with "rabbit" (1 time).
  * *4, omnivore:* Appears with "fox" and "platypus" (2 times).
  * *4, carnivore:* Appears with "platypus" (1 time).
  * *4, hot:* Appears with "rabbit," "fox," and "platypus" (3 times).
  * *4, yes (body hair):* Appears with "rabbit," "fox," and
    "platypus" (3 times).
  * *4, false (eggs):* Appears with "rabbit" and "fox" (2 times).
  * *4, indeed (breastfeeding):* Appears with "rabbit," "fox," and
    "platypus" (3 times).


      Pairs Involving "legs count" = 2:

  * *2, omnivore:* Appears with "human" (1 time).
  * *2, hot:* Appears with "human" (1 time).
  * *2, yes (body hair):* Appears with "human" (1 time).
  * *2, false (eggs):* Appears with "human" (1 time).
  * *2, indeed (breastfeeding):* Appears with "human" (1 time).


      Pairs Involving "omnivore":

  * *omnivore, hot:* Appears with "human" and "fox" (2 times).
  * *omnivore, yes (body hair):* Appears with "human" and "fox" (2 times).
  * *omnivore, false (eggs):* Appears with "human" and "fox" (2 times).
  * *omnivore, indeed (breastfeeding):* Appears with "human" and
    "fox" (2 times).


      Pairs Involving "hot":

  * *hot, yes (body hair):* Appears with "rabbit," "human," "fox," and
    "platypus" (4 times).
  * *hot, false (eggs):* Appears with "rabbit," "human," and "fox" (3
    times).
  * *hot, indeed (breastfeeding):* Appears with "rabbit," "human,"
    "fox," and "platypus" (4 times).


      Pairs Involving "yes (body hair)":

  * *yes, false (eggs):* Appears with "rabbit," "human," and "fox" (3
    times).
  * *yes, indeed (breastfeeding):* Appears with "rabbit," "human,"
    "fox," and "platypus" (4 times).


      Pairs Involving "false (eggs)":

  * *false, indeed (breastfeeding):* Appears with "rabbit," "human," and
    "fox" (3 times).

Now, we filter out the pairs that appear at least twice:


|set_length2 = {{"4","hot"},{"4","yes"},{"4","false"},{"4","indeed"},{"omnivore","hot"},{"omnivore","yes"},{"omnivore","false"},{"omnivore","indeed"},{"hot","yes"},{"hot","false"},{"hot","indeed"},{"yes","false"},{"yes","indeed"},{"false","indeed"}}
|

These are the itemsets with length 2 that appear at least twice in the
dataset.

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length
3, we need to consider triples of items from different columns and count
how many times each triple appears together in the dataset. Let's go
through the possible combinations:


      Triples Involving "legs count" = 4:

  * *4, omnivore, hot:* Appears with "fox" (1 time).
  * *4, omnivore, yes (body hair):* Appears with "fox" (1 time).
  * *4, omnivore, false (eggs):* Appears with "fox" (1 time).
  * *4, omnivore, indeed (breastfeeding):* Appears with "fox" (1 time).
  * *4, hot, yes (body hair):* Appears with "rabbit," "fox," and
    "platypus" (3 times).
  * *4, hot, false (eggs):* Appears with "rabbit" and "fox" (2 times).
  * *4, hot, indeed (breastfeeding):* Appears with "rabbit," "fox," and
    "platypus" (3 times).
  * *4, yes, false (eggs):* Appears with "rabbit" and "fox" (2 times).
  * *4, yes, indeed (breastfeeding):* Appears with "rabbit," "fox," and
    "platypus" (3 times).
  * *4, false, indeed (breastfeeding):* Appears with "rabbit" and
    "fox" (2 times).


      Triples Involving "omnivore":

  * *omnivore, hot, yes (body hair):* Appears with "human" and "fox" (2
    times).
  * *omnivore, hot, false (eggs):* Appears with "human" and "fox" (2 times).
  * *omnivore, hot, indeed (breastfeeding):* Appears with "human" and
    "fox" (2 times).
  * *omnivore, yes, false (eggs):* Appears with "human" and "fox" (2 times).
  * *omnivore, yes, indeed (breastfeeding):* Appears with "human" and
    "fox" (2 times).
  * *omnivore, false, indeed (breastfeeding):* Appears with "human" and
    "fox" (2 times).


      Triples Involving "hot":

  * *hot, yes, false (eggs):* Appears with "rabbit," "human," and
    "fox" (3 times).
  * *hot, yes, indeed (breastfeeding):* Appears with "rabbit," "human,"

  * *hot, false, indeed (breastfeeding):* Appears with "rabbit,"
    "human," and "fox" (3 times).


      Triples Involving "yes (body hair)":

  * *yes, false, indeed (breastfeeding):* Appears with "rabbit,"
    "human," and "fox" (3 times).

Now, we filter out the triples that appear at least twice:



|set_length3 = {{"4","hot","yes"},{"4","hot","indeed"},{"4","yes","indeed"},{"omnivore","hot","yes"},{"omnivore","hot","false"},{"omnivore","hot","indeed"},{"omnivore","yes","false"},{"omnivore","yes","indeed"},{"omnivore","false","indeed"},{"hot","yes","false"},{"hot","yes","indeed"},{"hot","false","indeed"},{"yes","false","indeed"}}

      Quadruples Involving "hot":

  * *hot, yes, false, indeed (breastfeeding):* Appears with "rabbit,"
    "human," and "fox" (3 times).

Now, we filter out the quadruples that appear at least twice:

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length
5, we need to consider quintuples of items from different columns and
count how many times each quintuple appears together in the dataset.
Let's go through the possible combinations:


      Quintuples Involving "legs count" = 4:

  * *4, omnivore, hot, yes, false (eggs):* Appears with "fox" (1 time).
  * *4, omnivore, hot, yes, indeed (breastfeeding):* Appears with
    "fox" (1 time).
  * *4, omnivore, hot, false, indeed (breastfeeding):* Appears with
