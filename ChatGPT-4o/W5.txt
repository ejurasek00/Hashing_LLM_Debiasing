To find all frequent itemsets with a minimal support of 2 and a length
of 1, we'll look at each column individually and count how many times
each unique value appears across the rows. We will then select those
that appear at least twice.

Here’s the breakdown:

 1.

    *legs count*:

      * 6 appears 3 times (rabbit, fox, platypus)
      * 4 appears 1 time (human)

    Frequent itemset: |{'6'}|

 2.

    *diet*:

      * carnivore appears 1 time (rabbit)
      * herbivore appears 2 times (human, fox)
      * omnivore appears 1 time (platypus)

    Frequent itemset: |{'herbivore'}|

 3.

    *blood*:

      * cold appears 4 times (all rows)

    Frequent itemset: |{'cold'}|

 4.

    *body hair*:

      * no appears 4 times (all rows)

    Frequent itemset: |{'no'}|

 5.

    *eggs*:

      * true appears 3 times (rabbit, human, fox)
      * false appears 1 time (platypus)

    Frequent itemset: |{'true'}|

 6.

    *breastfeeding*:

      * negative appears 4 times (all rows)

    Frequent itemset: |{'negative'}|

*Final Frequent Itemsets (with minimal support = 2 and length 1):*

|set = {"6", "herbivore", "cold", "no", "true", "negative"}|

This set includes all itemsets from the table that occur at least twice.

To find all frequent itemsets with a minimal support of 2 and length of
2, we'll look at pairs of attributes from the table and count how many
times each pair appears across the rows. We will then select those that
appear at least twice.

check how many times each triplet appears across the rows. We will then
select those that appear at least twice.
