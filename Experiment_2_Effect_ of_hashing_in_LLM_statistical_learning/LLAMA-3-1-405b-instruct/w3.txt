LLAMA

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 1, we need to identify the items that appear at least twice in each column.

Here are the results:

    For the "name" column, no itemsets can be formed as each name is unique.
    For the "legs count" column, the itemset {6} appears three times, and the itemset {4} appears once but does not meet the minimal support.
    For the "diet" column, the itemsets {"carnivore"}, {"herbivore"}, and {"omnivore"} appear, but only {"herbivore"} meets the minimal support.
    For the "blood" column, the itemset {"cold"} appears four times.
    For the "body hair" column, the itemset {"no"} appears four times.
    For the "eggs" column, the itemset {"true"} appears three times.
    For the "breastfeeding" column, the itemset {"negative"} appears four times.

Therefore, the set_length_1 is:

set_length_1 = {{"6"},{"herbivore"},{"cold"},{"no"},{"true"},{"negative"}}

LLAMA

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 2, we need to identify the combinations of two items that appear at least twice.

Here are the results:

    The combination of "6" and "cold" appears three times.
    The combination of "6" and "no" appears three times.
    The combination of "6" and "negative" appears three times.
    The combination of "herbivore" and "cold" appears twice.
    The combination of "herbivore" and "no" appears twice.
    The combination of "herbivore" and "true" appears twice.
    The combination of "herbivore" and "negative" appears twice.
    The combination of "cold" and "no" appears four times.
    The combination of "cold" and "negative" appears four times.
    The combination of "no" and "negative" appears four times.
    The combination of "true" and "negative" appears three times.

Therefore, the set_length_2 is:

set_length_2 = {{"6","cold"},{"6","no"},{"6","negative"},{"herbivore","cold"},{"herbivore","no"},{"herbivore","true"},{"herbivore","negative"},{"cold","no"},{"cold","negative"},{"no","negative"},{"true","negative"}}

LLAMA

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 3, we need to identify the combinations of three items that appear at least twice.

Here are the results:

    The combination of "6", "cold", and "no" appears three times.
    The combination of "6", "cold", and "negative" appears three times.
    The combination of "6", "no", and "negative" appears three times.
    The combination of "herbivore", "cold", and "no" appears twice.
    The combination of "herbivore", "cold", and "negative" appears twice.
    The combination of "herbivore", "no", and "negative" appears twice.
    The combination of "herbivore", "true", and "negative" appears twice.
    The combination of "cold", "no", and "negative" appears four times.

Therefore, the set_length_3 is:

set_length_3 = {{"6","cold","no"},{"6","cold","negative"},{"6","no","negative"},{"herbivore","cold","no"},{"herbivore","cold","negative"},{"herbivore","no","negative"},{"herbivore","true","negative"},{"cold","no","negative"}}

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 5, we need to identify the combinations of five items that appear at least twice.

Here are the results:

    The combination of "herbivore", "cold", "no", "true", and "negative" appears twice.

set_length_5 = {{"herbivore","cold","no","true","negative"}}
