We are given 5 transactions (rows), and we are to find all frequent itemsets of length 1 (i.e., individual items) that appear in at least 2 transactions (i.e., have a minimum support of 2).
Step 1: List all items per transaction

    Row 1: 354C31, DBCEEF, 6CE255, 199D26, D59553, 331981, 869F50

    Row 2: B2895C, B0FAAD, 9ED0E8, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999

    Row 3: 1520D1, 49E95E, A6463C, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999

    Row 4: 0BEA8D, B0FAAD, A6463C, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999

    Row 5: 7EA60D, B0FAAD, C5B9CC, D11884, 269963, 420666, 999999

Step 2: Count the support of each item

Let’s count how many times each item appears across the 5 transactions:

    354C31 → 1

    DBCEEF → 1

    6CE255 → 1

    199D26 → 1

    D59553 → 1

    331981 → 1

    869F50 → 1

    B2895C → 1

    B0FAAD → 3 ✅

    9ED0E8 → 1

    D11884 → 4 ✅

    269963 → 4 ✅

    ADC8A2 → 3 ✅

    999999 → 4 ✅

    1520D1 → 1

    49E95E → 1

    A6463C → 2 ✅

    0BEA8D → 1

    7EA60D → 1

    C5B9CC → 1

    420666 → 1

Step 3: Select items with support ≥ 2

Items that appear at least twice are:

    B0FAAD

    D11884

    269963

    ADC8A2

    999999

    A6463C

Step 4: Format as set of sets

We are to write the final result as a string formatted like this:

set={{"item 1"},{"item 2"}}

✅ Final Answer:

set={{"B0FAAD"},{"D11884"},{"269963"},{"ADC8A2"},{"999999"},{"A6463C"}}

We need to find all frequent itemsets of length 2 (i.e., pairs of items) that appear in at least 2 transactions.
Step 1: List transactions as sets of items

    T1 = {354C31, DBCEEF, 6CE255, 199D26, D59553, 331981, 869F50}

    T2 = {B2895C, B0FAAD, 9ED0E8, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999}

    T3 = {1520D1, 49E95E, A6463C, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999}

    T4 = {0BEA8D, B0FAAD, A6463C, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999}

    T5 = {7EA60D, B0FAAD, C5B9CC, D11884, 269963, 420666, 999999}

Step 2: Generate all pairs from each transaction

We extract all 2-item combinations per transaction and count how often each appears across all 5 transactions.

Let’s focus only on pairs that could possibly be frequent (i.e., involve the items that were frequent in length-1, since any subset of a frequent itemset must also be frequent):

From previous task, frequent items were:
{B0FAAD, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999, A6463C}

So, we only consider pairs among these 6 items. All possible 2-item combinations from them are:

    {B0FAAD, D11884}

    {B0FAAD, 269963}

    {B0FAAD, ADC8A2}

    {B0FAAD, 999999}

    {B0FAAD, A6463C}

    {D11884, 269963}

    {D11884, ADC8A2}

    {D11884, 999999}

    {D11884, A6463C}

    {269963, ADC8A2}

    {269963, 999999}

    {269963, A6463C}

    {ADC8A2, 999999}

    {ADC8A2, A6463C}

    {999999, A6463C}

Step 3: Count supports (how many transactions each pair appears in)

We check each of the 5 transactions and tally where each pair appears.
Count:

    {B0FAAD, D11884} → T2, T4, T5 → 3 ✅

    {B0FAAD, 269963} → T2, T4, T5 → 3 ✅

    {B0FAAD, ADC8A2} → T2, T4 → 2 ✅

    {B0FAAD, 999999} → T2, T4, T5 → 3 ✅

    {B0FAAD, A6463C} → T4 → 1 ✖

    {D11884, 269963} → T2, T3, T4, T5 → 4 ✅

    {D11884, ADC8A2} → T2, T3, T4 → 3 ✅

    {D11884, 999999} → T2, T3, T4, T5 → 4 ✅

    {D11884, A6463C} → T3, T4 → 2 ✅

    {269963, ADC8A2} → T2, T3, T4 → 3 ✅

    {269963, 999999} → T2, T3, T4, T5 → 4 ✅

    {269963, A6463C} → T3, T4 → 2 ✅

    {ADC8A2, 999999} → T2, T3, T4 → 3 ✅

    {ADC8A2, A6463C} → T3, T4 → 2 ✅

    {999999, A6463C} → T3, T4 → 2 ✅

Step 4: List pairs with support ≥ 2

All pairs above except {B0FAAD, A6463C} have support ≥ 2.
✅ Final Answer (formatted as set of sets of strings):

set={{"B0FAAD","D11884"},{"B0FAAD","269963"},{"B0FAAD","ADC8A2"},{"B0FAAD","999999"},{"D11884","269963"},{"D11884","ADC8A2"},{"D11884","999999"},{"D11884","A6463C"},{"269963","ADC8A2"},{"269963","999999"},{"269963","A6463C"},{"ADC8A2","999999"},{"ADC8A2","A6463C"},{"999999","A6463C"}}

We are to find all frequent itemsets of length 3 with minimum support 2 — i.e., all triplets of items that appear together in at least 2 transactions.
Step 1: Restrict to frequent items

From previous tasks, we know the frequent length-1 items (support ≥ 2) are:

B0FAAD, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999, A6463C

We will generate all possible 3-item combinations from these.
Step 2: Generate all 3-item combinations

From 6 items, combinations of 3 without repetition:

    {B0FAAD, D11884, 269963}

    {B0FAAD, D11884, ADC8A2}

    {B0FAAD, D11884, 999999}

    {B0FAAD, D11884, A6463C}

    {B0FAAD, 269963, ADC8A2}

    {B0FAAD, 269963, 999999}

    {B0FAAD, 269963, A6463C}

    {B0FAAD, ADC8A2, 999999}

    {B0FAAD, ADC8A2, A6463C}

    {B0FAAD, 999999, A6463C}

    {D11884, 269963, ADC8A2}

    {D11884, 269963, 999999}

    {D11884, 269963, A6463C}

    {D11884, ADC8A2, 999999}

    {D11884, ADC8A2, A6463C}

    {D11884, 999999, A6463C}

    {269963, ADC8A2, 999999}

    {269963, ADC8A2, A6463C}

    {269963, 999999, A6463C}

    {ADC8A2, 999999, A6463C}

→ Total: 20 combinations
Step 3: Count support for each triplet

We'll go through transactions 2 to 5 (since T1 doesn't contain any frequent items):
T2 = {B0FAAD, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999}

Triplets in T2:

    All combinations of its 5 items (excluding A6463C)

Triplets from T2:

    {B0FAAD, D11884, 999999}

    {B0FAAD, 269963, ADC8A2}

    {B0FAAD, 269963, 999999}

    {B0FAAD, ADC8A2, 999999}

    {D11884, 269963, ADC8A2}

    {D11884, 269963, 999999}

    {D11884, ADC8A2, 999999}

    {269963, ADC8A2, 999999}

T3 = {D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999, A6463C}

Triplets in T3:

    {D11884, 269963, ADC8A2}

    {D11884, 269963, 999999}

    {D11884, 269963, A6463C}

    {D11884, ADC8A2, 999999}

    {D11884, ADC8A2, A6463C}

    {D11884, 999999, A6463C}

    {269963, ADC8A2, 999999}

    {269963, ADC8A2, A6463C}

    {269963, 999999, A6463C}

    {ADC8A2, 999999, A6463C}

T4 = {B0FAAD, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999, A6463C}

Triplets in T4:

    All combinations from above (5 frequent items + A6463C), except those involving {B0FAAD, A6463C}

Triplets from T4 (that match the combinations list):

    {B0FAAD, D11884, 269963}

    {B0FAAD, D11884, ADC8A2}

    {B0FAAD, D11884, 999999}

    {269963, 999999, A6463C}

    {ADC8A2, 999999, A6463C}

T5 = {B0FAAD, D11884, 269963, 999999}

Triplets in T5:

    {B0FAAD, D11884, 269963}

    {B0FAAD, D11884, 999999}

    {B0FAAD, 269963, 999999}

    {D11884, 269963, 999999}

Step 4: Count how many transactions each triplet appears in

We'll tally up support (only include triplets with support ≥ 2):
Triplet	Support

We are to find all frequent itemsets of length 4 with minimum support 2 — meaning all quadruples of items that appear together in at least 2 transactions.
Step 1: Use previously known frequent items

From earlier steps, the frequent items are:

{B0FAAD, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999, A6463C}

We will generate all 4-item combinations from these 6 frequent items.
Step 2: List all possible 4-item combinations

From 6 items, the number of 4-item combinations is C(6,4) = 15. The combinations are:

    {B0FAAD, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2}

    {B0FAAD, D11884, 269963, 999999}

    {B0FAAD, D11884, 269963, A6463C}

    {B0FAAD, D11884, ADC8A2, 999999}

    {B0FAAD, D11884, ADC8A2, A6463C}

    {B0FAAD, D11884, 999999, A6463C}

    {B0FAAD, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999}

    {B0FAAD, 269963, ADC8A2, A6463C}

    {B0FAAD, 269963, 999999, A6463C}

    {B0FAAD, ADC8A2, 999999, A6463C}

    {D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999}

    {D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, A6463C}

    {D11884, 269963, 999999, A6463C}

    {D11884, ADC8A2, 999999, A6463C}

    {269963, ADC8A2, 999999, A6463C}

Step 3: Identify which of these combinations appear in ≥ 2 transactions

We'll manually check transactions T2 to T5 (since T1 doesn't include any frequent items).
Transactions:

    T2: {B0FAAD, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999}

    T3: {D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999, A6463C}

    T4: {B0FAAD, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999, A6463C}

    T5: {B0FAAD, D11884, 269963, 999999}

Now we check each of the 15 combinations for presence in these transactions.
Step 4: Support counts (✔ means appears in transaction)
Combination	T2	T3	T4	T5	Support
{B0FAAD, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2}	✔		✔		2 ✅

{269963, ADC8A2, 999999, A6463C}		✔	✔		2 ✅

Find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 5, so set_length_5= {<<itemsets>>}. Instead of placeholder <<itemsets>>, insert the itemsets with corresponding length formatted as python set, all formatted as string; for instance set={{"item 1"},{"item 2"}} without the column names and ().  Consider the first row of the CSV as the name of the columns.

We are to find all frequent itemsets of length 5 with minimum support of 2, meaning all 5-item combinations that appear in at least 2 transactions.
Step 1: Recall frequent items from earlier

From prior analysis, the items that appear in ≥2 transactions are:

{B0FAAD, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999, A6463C}

We'll generate all 5-item combinations from these 6 items.
Step 2: Generate all possible 5-item combinations

C(6,5) = 6 combinations:

    {B0FAAD, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999}

    {B0FAAD, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, A6463C}

    {B0FAAD, D11884, 269963, 999999, A6463C}

    {B0FAAD, D11884, ADC8A2, 999999, A6463C}

    {B0FAAD, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999, A6463C}

    {D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999, A6463C}

Step 3: Check which transactions contain these combinations

Focus on transactions T2 through T5:

    T2: {B0FAAD, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999}

    T3: {D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999, A6463C}

    T4: {B0FAAD, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999, A6463C}

    T5: {B0FAAD, D11884, 269963, 999999}

Now check each 5-itemset:

    {B0FAAD, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999}

        Appears in T2, T4 → ✅ Support = 2

    {B0FAAD, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, A6463C}

        Appears only in T4 → ✖ Support = 1

    {B0FAAD, D11884, 269963, 999999, A6463C}

        Appears only in T4 → ✖ Support = 1

    {B0FAAD, D11884, ADC8A2, 999999, A6463C}

        Appears only in T4 → ✖ Support = 1

    {B0FAAD, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999, A6463C}

        Appears only in T4 → ✖ Support = 1

    {D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999, A6463C}

        Appears in T3, T4 → ✅ Support = 2

Step 4: Final frequent 5-itemsets (support ≥ 2)

    {B0FAAD, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999}

    {D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999, A6463C}

✅ Final Answer (formatted as set of sets of strings):

set={{"B0FAAD","D11884","269963","ADC8A2","999999"},{"D11884","269963","ADC8A2","999999","A6463C"}}
