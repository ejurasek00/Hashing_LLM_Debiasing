We are asked to find frequent itemsets of length 1 (individual items) with minimum support = 2 — i.e., items that appear in at least two transactions.
Step 1: Parse the transactions

We'll extract all items from each row and organize them:

    354,312,624,199,359,331,869
    → {354, 312, 624, 199, 359, 331, 869}

    128,105,943,311,269,032,999
    → {128, 105, 943, 311, 269, 032, 999}

    152,494,064,311,269,032,999
    → {152, 494, 064, 311, 269, 032, 999}

    014,105,064,311,269,032,999
    → {014, 105, 064, 311, 269, 032, 999}

    740,105,251,311,269,420,999
    → {740, 105, 251, 311, 269, 420, 999}

Step 2: Count item frequencies

Let’s count how often each item appears across all 5 transactions:

    032 → in rows 2, 3, 4, 5 → 4 times ✅

    105 → in rows 2, 4, 5 → 3 times ✅

    311 → in rows 2, 3, 4, 5 → 4 times ✅

    269 → in rows 2, 3, 4, 5 → 4 times ✅

    999 → in rows 2, 3, 4, 5 → 4 times ✅

    064 → in rows 3, 4 → 2 times ✅

    354 → 1 time ✖

    312 → 1 time ✖

    624 → 1 time ✖

    199 → 1 time ✖

    359 → 1 time ✖

    331 → 1 time ✖

    869 → 1 time ✖

    128 → 1 time ✖

    943 → 1 time ✖

    152 → 1 time ✖

    494 → 1 time ✖

    014 → 1 time ✖

    740 → 1 time ✖

    251 → 1 time ✖

    420 → 1 time ✖

Step 3: Keep items with frequency ≥ 2

These are the frequent itemsets of length 1:

    {"032"}, {"105"}, {"311"}, {"269"}, {"999"}, {"064"}

✅ Final Answer:

set={{"032"},{"105"},{"311"},{"269"},{"999"},{"064"}}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 2, so set_length_2= {<<itemsets>>}. Instead of placeholder <<itemsets>>, insert the itemsets with corresponding length formatted as python set, all formatted as string; for instance set={{"item 1"},{"item 2"}} without the column names and (). Consider the first row of the CSV as the name of the columns.

We are asked to find frequent itemsets of length 2 (pairs of items) that appear in at least 2 transactions from the provided dataset.
Step 1: List each transaction as a set

    {354, 312, 624, 199, 359, 331, 869}

    {128, 105, 943, 311, 269, 032, 999}

    {152, 494, 064, 311, 269, 032, 999}

    {014, 105, 064, 311, 269, 032, 999}

    {740, 105, 251, 311, 269, 420, 999}

Step 2: Find all item pairs (length 2) in each transaction

We'll collect all pairs in each transaction and count their total occurrences across all 5.

Transaction 2:
{105, 943, 311, 269, 032, 999, 128}
→ frequent item candidates: 105, 311, 269, 032, 999

So possible pairs from this transaction:

    {105, 311}

    {105, 269}

    {105, 032}

    {105, 999}

    {311, 269}

    {311, 032}

    {311, 999}

    {269, 032}

    {269, 999}

    {032, 999}

We repeat this logic for each transaction that contains frequent items.
Step 3: Track how many times each pair appears

We’ll list each pair that appears in 2 or more transactions.

From transactions 2, 3, 4, and 5 — we analyze the overlapping pairs:
Potential frequent items:

(From previous task):
032, 105, 311, 269, 999, 064

We’ll test combinations among those:

Pairs & Support Count:

    {"032", "105"} → tx 2, 4 → ✔️ 2

    {"032", "311"} → tx 2, 3, 4 → ✔️ 3

    {"032", "269"} → tx 2, 3, 4 → ✔️ 3

    {"032", "999"} → tx 2, 3, 4, 5 → ✔️ 4

    {"032", "064"} → tx 3, 4 → ✔️ 2

    {"105", "311"} → tx 2, 4, 5 → ✔️ 3

    {"105", "269"} → tx 2, 4, 5 → ✔️ 3

    {"105", "999"} → tx 2, 4, 5 → ✔️ 3

    {"105", "064"} → tx 4 → ✖️ only once

    {"311", "269"} → tx 2, 3, 4, 5 → ✔️ 4

    {"311", "999"} → tx 2, 3, 4, 5 → ✔️ 4

    {"311", "064"} → tx 3, 4 → ✔️ 2

    {"269", "999"} → tx 2, 3, 4, 5 → ✔️ 4

    {"269", "064"} → tx 3, 4 → ✔️ 2

    {"999", "064"} → tx 3, 4 → ✔️ 2

✅ Final Result

Frequent length-2 itemsets with support ≥ 2:

set={{"032","105"},{"032","311"},{"032","269"},{"032","999"},{"032","064"},{"105","311"},{"105","269"},{"105","999"},{"311","269"},{"311","999"},{"311","064"},{"269","999"},{"269","064"},{"999","064"}}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 3, so set_length_3= {<<itemsets>>}. Instead of placeholder <<itemsets>>, insert the itemsets with corresponding length formatted as python set, all formatted as string; for instance set={{"item 1"},{"item 2"}} without the column names and (). Consider the first row of the CSV as the name of the columns.

We are asked to find frequent itemsets of length 3 (triplets) with minimum support = 2, meaning each triplet must appear in at least 2 transactions.
✅ Step 1: Identify Frequent Items

From previous steps, the frequent items (with support ≥ 2) are:

032, 064, 105, 269, 311, 999

We'll generate all possible 3-item combinations (triplets) from these:

    {"032", "105", "311"}

    {"032", "105", "269"}

    {"032", "105", "999"}

    {"032", "105", "064"}

    {"032", "311", "269"}

    {"032", "311", "999"}

    {"032", "311", "064"}

    {"032", "269", "999"}

    {"032", "269", "064"}

    {"032", "999", "064"}

    {"105", "311", "269"}

    {"105", "311", "999"}

    {"105", "311", "064"}

    {"105", "269", "999"}

    {"105", "269", "064"}

    {"105", "999", "064"}

    {"311", "269", "999"}

    {"311", "269", "064"}

    {"311", "999", "064"}

    {"269", "999", "064"}

Now, we check in which transactions these combinations appear.
✅ Step 2: Check Support (Must be in ≥ 2 Transactions)

Let’s look at the 5 transactions with just frequent items:

Tx 2: {105, 311, 269, 032, 999}
Tx 3: {064, 311, 269, 032, 999}
Tx 4: {105, 064, 311, 269, 032, 999}
Tx 5: {105, 311, 269, 999}
(Tx 1 doesn't contain any frequent item)

Now test which of the triplets appear in at least 2 of the above 4 transactions:

Triplets with support ≥ 2:

    {"032", "105", "311"} → Tx 2, 4 ✔

    {"032", "105", "269"} → Tx 2, 4 ✔

    {"032", "105", "999"} → Tx 2, 4 ✔

    {"032", "999", "064"} → Tx 3, 4 ✔

    {"311", "269", "064"} → Tx 3, 4 ✔

    {"311", "999", "064"} → Tx 3, 4 ✔

    {"269", "999", "064"} → Tx 3, 4 ✔

✅ Final Answer:

set={{"032","105","311"},{"032","105","269"},{"032","105","999"},{"032","311","269"},{"032","311","999"},{"032","269","999"},{"105","311","269"},{"105","311","999"},{"105","269","999"},{"311","269","999"},{"032","311","064"},{"032","269","064"},{"032","999","064"},{"311","269","064"},{"311","999","064"},{"269","999","064"}}

We are asked to find all frequent itemsets of length 4 with support ≥ 2 — that is, 4-item combinations that appear in at least 2 transactions.
✅ Step 1: List frequent items

From prior steps, we’ve already determined that the items with support ≥ 2 are:

032, 064, 105, 269, 311, 999

From these, we generate all possible 4-item combinations.
✅ Step 2: List 4-item combinations (from the 6 frequent items)

There are 15 unique 4-item combinations (from 6 choose 4):

    {"032", "064", "105", "269"}

    {"032", "064", "105", "311"}

    {"032", "064", "105", "999"}

    {"032", "064", "269", "311"}

    {"032", "064", "269", "999"}

    {"032", "064", "311", "999"}

    {"032", "105", "269", "311"}

    {"032", "105", "269", "999"}

    {"032", "105", "311", "999"}

    {"032", "269", "311", "999"}

    {"064", "105", "269", "311"}

    {"064", "105", "269", "999"}

    {"064", "105", "311", "999"}

    {"064", "269", "311", "999"}

    {"105", "269", "311", "999"}

✅ Step 3: Identify which appear in ≥ 2 transactions

We'll analyze the frequent-item-only parts of the transactions:

    Tx 2: {105, 311, 269, 032, 999}

    Tx 3: {064, 311, 269, 032, 999}

    Tx 4: {105, 064, 311, 269, 032, 999}

    Tx 5: {105, 311, 269, 999}

Now we test which 4-item sets appear in at least 2 of these transactions.
Frequent 4-itemsets (support ≥ 2):

    {"032", "105", "269", "311"} → Tx 2, 4 ✔

    {"032", "105", "269", "999"} → Tx 2, 4 ✔

    {"032", "105", "311", "999"} → Tx 2, 4 ✔

    {"032", "269", "311", "999"} → Tx 2, 3, 4 ✔

    {"032", "064", "269", "311"} → Tx 3, 4 ✔

    {"032", "064", "269", "999"} → Tx 3, 4 ✔

    {"032", "064", "311", "999"} → Tx 3, 4 ✔

    {"064", "269", "311", "999"} → Tx 3, 4 ✔

    {"105", "269", "311", "999"} → Tx 2, 4, 5 ✔

✅ Final Answer:

set={{"032","105","269","311"},{"032","105","269","999"},{"032","105","311","999"},{"032","269","311","999"},{"032","064","269","311"},{"032","064","269","999"},{"032","064","311","999"},{"064","269","311","999"},{"105","269","311","999"}}

We are asked to find frequent itemsets of length 5 (5-item combinations) with minimum support = 2, meaning the itemset must appear in at least two transactions.
✅ Step 1: Use frequent items

From previous analysis, the frequent items are:

Frequent items: 032, 064, 105, 269, 311, 999

We'll generate all 5-item combinations from these.

There are 6 choose 5 = 6 possible 5-item combinations:

    {"032", "064", "105", "269", "311"}

    {"032", "064", "105", "269", "999"}

    {"032", "064", "105", "311", "999"}

    {"032", "064", "269", "311", "999"}

    {"032", "105", "269", "311", "999"}

    {"064", "105", "269", "311", "999"}

✅ Step 2: Check which combinations appear in ≥ 2 transactions

Let’s analyze frequent-item parts of transactions 2–5:

    Tx 2: {032, 105, 269, 311, 999}

    Tx 3: {032, 064, 269, 311, 999}

    Tx 4: {032, 064, 105, 269, 311, 999}

    Tx 5: {105, 269, 311, 999}

Now we check which 5-item combinations appear in at least 2 of these:
Analyze each 5-itemset:

    {"032", "064", "105", "269", "311"}
    → Tx 4 only ✖️

    {"032", "064", "105", "269", "999"}
    → Tx 4 only ✖️

    {"032", "064", "105", "311", "999"}
    → Tx 4 only ✖️

    {"032", "064", "269", "311", "999"}
    → Tx 3, 4 ✅

    {"032", "105", "269", "311", "999"}
    → Tx 2, 4 ✅

    {"064", "105", "269", "311", "999"}
    → Tx 4, 5 ✖️ (Tx 5 does not contain 064)

Only two 5-itemsets meet the support ≥ 2 condition.
✅ Final Answer:

set={{"032","064","269","311","999"},{"032","105","269","311","999"}}
