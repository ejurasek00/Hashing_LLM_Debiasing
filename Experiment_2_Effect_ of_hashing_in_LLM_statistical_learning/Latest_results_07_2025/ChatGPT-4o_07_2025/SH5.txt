To find all frequent itemsets of length 1 (i.e., individual items) with a minimum support of 2, follow these manual steps:
Step 1: List All Transactions

Each line is a transaction:

    354, 312, 624, 199, 359, 331, 869

    128, 105, 943, 311, 269, 032, 999

    152, 494, 064, 311, 269, 032, 999

    014, 105, 064, 311, 269, 032, 999

    740, 105, 251, 311, 269, 420, 999

Step 2: Count Frequency of Each Item

Tally how many times each item appears across all transactions:
Item	Count
032	4
064	2
105	3
128	1
014	1
152	1
199	1
251	1
269	4
311	4
312	1
331	1
354	1
359	1
420	1
494	1
624	1
740	1
869	1
943	1
999	4
Step 3: Keep Only Items with Support ≥ 2

Items that appear 2 or more times:

    032

    064

    105

    269

    311

    999

Step 4: Format as Python Sets

Each item as a set of length 1, enclosed in double braces:

set={{"032"},{"064"},{"105"},{"269"},{"311"},{"999"}}

✅ Final Answer:

set_length_1 = {{"032"},{"064"},{"105"},{"269"},{"311"},{"999"}}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 2, so set_length_2= {<<itemsets>>}. Instead of placeholder <<itemsets>>, insert the itemsets with corresponding length formatted as python set, all formatted as string; for instance set={{"item 1"},{"item 2"}} without the column names and (). Consider the first row of the CSV as the name of the columns.

To find all frequent itemsets of length 2 with minimum support = 2, we must identify all pairs of items that appear together in at least 2 transactions.
Step 1: Write Out Each Transaction

    {354, 312, 624, 199, 359, 331, 869}

    {128, 105, 943, 311, 269, 032, 999}

    {152, 494, 064, 311, 269, 032, 999}

    {014, 105, 064, 311, 269, 032, 999}

    {740, 105, 251, 311, 269, 420, 999}

Step 2: Identify All Candidate Pairs and Their Frequencies

We only consider items that occur together in at least 2 transactions.

We will focus on items that occurred frequently (from previous task):
032, 064, 105, 269, 311, 999

Now check all 2-item combinations among those and count how many times each pair appears together:

Let’s manually count how often each of these pairs appear together:
Pairs:

    {"032", "064"} → in Txn 3 and 4 → ✅ 2

    {"032", "105"} → in Txn 2 and 4 → ✅ 2

    {"032", "269"} → in Txns 2, 3, 4 → ✅ 3

    {"032", "311"} → in Txns 2, 3, 4 → ✅ 3

    {"032", "999"} → in Txns 2, 3, 4 → ✅ 3

    {"064", "105"} → in Txns 4 → only 1 → ❌

    {"064", "269"} → in Txns 3 and 4 → ✅ 2

    {"064", "311"} → in Txns 3 and 4 → ✅ 2

    {"064", "999"} → in Txns 3 and 4 → ✅ 2

    {"105", "269"} → in Txns 2, 4, 5 → ✅ 3

    {"105", "311"} → in Txns 2, 4, 5 → ✅ 3

    {"105", "999"} → in Txns 2, 4, 5 → ✅ 3

    {"269", "311"} → in Txns 2, 3, 4, 5 → ✅ 4

    {"269", "999"} → in Txns 2, 3, 4, 5 → ✅ 4

    {"311", "999"} → in Txns 2, 3, 4, 5 → ✅ 4

Step 3: List All Valid Frequent Pairs (Support ≥ 2)

All frequent 2-itemsets (length 2) with support ≥ 2 are:

set={{"032","064"},{"032","105"},{"032","269"},{"032","311"},{"032","999"},{"064","269"},{"064","311"},{"064","999"},{"105","269"},{"105","311"},{"105","999"},{"269","311"},{"269","999"},{"311","999"}}

✅ Final Answer:

set_length_2 = {{"032","064"},{"032","105"},{"032","269"},{"032","311"},{"032","999"},{"064","269"},{"064","311"},{"064","999"},{"105","269"},{"105","311"},{"105","999"},{"269","311"},{"269","999"},{"311","999"}}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 3, so set_length_3= {<<itemsets>>}. Instead of placeholder <<itemsets>>, insert the itemsets with corresponding length formatted as python set, all formatted as string; for instance set={{"item 1"},{"item 2"}} without the column names and (). Consider the first row of the CSV as the name of the columns.

354,312,624,199,359,331,869

We are tasked with finding all frequent itemsets of length 3 that appear in at least 2 transactions.
✅ Step 1: Use Only Frequent Items

From previous steps, frequent items (support ≥ 2) are:

032, 064, 105, 269, 311, 999

Now list all 3-item combinations of these:

Candidate Triplets:

    {"032", "064", "105"}

    {"032", "064", "269"}

    {"032", "064", "311"}

    {"032", "064", "999"}

    {"032", "105", "269"}

    {"032", "105", "311"}

    {"032", "105", "999"}

    {"032", "269", "311"}

    {"032", "269", "999"}

    {"032", "311", "999"}

    {"064", "105", "269"}

    {"064", "105", "311"}

    {"064", "105", "999"}

    {"064", "269", "311"}

    {"064", "269", "999"}

    {"064", "311", "999"}

    {"105", "269", "311"}

    {"105", "269", "999"}

    {"105", "311", "999"}

    {"269", "311", "999"}

✅ Step 2: Count How Many Transactions Each Triplet Appears In

We go through each triplet manually:
Transactions:

    Txn 2: {128,105,943,311,269,032,999}

    Txn 3: {152,494,064,311,269,032,999}

    Txn 4: {014,105,064,311,269,032,999}

    Txn 5: {740,105,251,311,269,420,999}

Now check for each triplet how often it appears.
Valid Triplets with ≥ 2 Support:

    {"032", "064", "269"} → Txns 3 & 4 ✅

    {"032", "064", "311"} → Txns 3 & 4 ✅

    {"032", "064", "999"} → Txns 3 & 4 ✅

    {"032", "269", "311"} → Txns 2, 3, 4 ✅

    {"032", "269", "999"} → Txns 2, 3, 4 ✅

    {"032", "311", "999"} → Txns 2, 3, 4 ✅

    {"064", "269", "311"} → Txns 3 & 4 ✅

    {"064", "269", "999"} → Txns 3 & 4 ✅

    {"064", "311", "999"} → Txns 3 & 4 ✅

    {"105", "269", "311"} → Txns 2, 4, 5 ✅

    {"105", "269", "999"} → Txns 2, 4, 5 ✅

    {"105", "311", "999"} → Txns 2, 4, 5 ✅

    {"269", "311", "999"} → Txns 2, 3, 4, 5 ✅

✅ Step 3: Format the Frequent 3-itemsets

set={{
  {"032","064","269"},
  {"032","064","311"},
  {"032","064","999"},
  {"032","269","311"},
  {"032","269","999"},
  {"032","311","999"},
  {"064","269","311"},
  {"064","269","999"},
  {"064","311","999"},
  {"105","269","311"},
  {"105","269","999"},
  {"105","311","999"},
  {"269","311","999"}
}}

✅ Final Answer:

set_length_3 = {{"032","064","269"},{"032","064","311"},{"032","064","999"},{"032","269","311"},{"032","269","999"},{"032","311","999"},{"064","269","311"},{"064","269","999"},{"064","311","999"},{"105","269","311"},{"105","269","999"},{"105","311","999"},{"269","311","999"}}

We are asked to find all frequent itemsets of length 4 that appear in at least 2 transactions.
✅ Step 1: Use Only Frequent Items

From previous results, frequent items (support ≥ 2) are:

032, 064, 105, 269, 311, 999

We now form 4-item combinations from these 6 items.
✅ Step 2: List All Candidate 4-Itemsets

All possible 4-item combinations among the 6 frequent items:

    {"032", "064", "105", "269"}

    {"032", "064", "105", "311"}

    {"032", "064", "105", "999"}

    {"032", "064", "269", "311"}

    {"032", "064", "269", "999"}

    {"032", "064", "311", "999"}

    {"032", "105", "269", "311"}

    {"032", "105", "269", "999"}

    {"032", "105", "311", "999"}

    {"064", "105", "311", "999"}

    {"064", "269", "311", "999"}

    {"105", "269", "311", "999"}

Now check which of these appear in at least 2 transactions.
✅ Step 3: Manually Check Each Candidate in the Transactions

Relevant Transactions:

    Txn 2: {105, 311, 269, 032, 999}

    Txn 3: {064, 311, 269, 032, 999}

    Txn 4: {105, 064, 311, 269, 032, 999}

    Txn 5: {105, 311, 269, 999}

Check support ≥ 2:

    {"032", "064", "269", "311"} → Txn 3, 4 ✅

    {"032", "064", "269", "999"} → Txn 3, 4 ✅

    {"032", "064", "311", "999"} → Txn 3, 4 ✅
