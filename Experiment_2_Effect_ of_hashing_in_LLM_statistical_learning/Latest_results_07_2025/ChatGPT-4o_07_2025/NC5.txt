To find all frequent itemsets of length 1 with a minimum support of 2, we need to analyze the table row by row and count how often each unique attribute value appears. An itemset of length 1 is just one attribute-value pair, like "legs count=4" or "diet=omnivore".

Here’s the dataset again:
name	legs count	diet	blood	body hair	eggs	breastfeeding
rabbit	4	herbivore	hot	yes	false	indeed
human	2	omnivore	hot	yes	false	indeed
fox	4	omnivore	hot	yes	false	indeed
platypus	4	carnivore	hot	yes	true	indeed

Now, let’s find all attribute-value pairs (length-1 itemsets), and their counts:
Step 1: Count each unique value (ignore "name" column)

    legs count:

        4 → 3 times (rabbit, fox, platypus)

        2 → 1 time (human)

    diet:

        herbivore → 1

        omnivore → 2

        carnivore → 1

    blood:

        hot → 4 (all)

    body hair:

        yes → 4 (all)

    eggs:

        false → 3

        true → 1

    breastfeeding:

        indeed → 4

Step 2: Select only those with support ≥ 2

These are the frequent itemsets of length 1:

    legs count=4

    diet=omnivore

    blood=hot

    body hair=yes

    eggs=false

    breastfeeding=indeed

Step 3: Format as Python set of sets of strings

Each itemset is a singleton set of a string, like {"legs count=4"}.
✅ Final Answer:

set_length1 = {{"legs count=4"}, {"diet=omnivore"}, {"blood=hot"}, {"body hair=yes"}, {"eggs=false"}, {"breastfeeding=indeed"}}

Find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 2, so set_length2= {<<itemsets>>}. Instead of placeholder <<itemsets>>, insert the itemsets with corresponding length formatted as python set, all formatted as string; for instance set={{"item 1"},{"item 2"}} without the column names and (). Consider the first row of the CSV as the name of the columns.

To find all frequent itemsets of length 2 with minimum support = 2, we must:

    List all combinations of length-1 itemsets.

    Combine them into all possible pairs (length-2 itemsets).

    Check how many rows contain each combination.

    Keep only those that appear in at least 2 rows.

Step 1: List all attribute-value pairs from the dataset (except "name")

From the 4 entries:

    legs count=4 (3 times)

    legs count=2 (1 time)

    diet=herbivore (1)

    diet=omnivore (2)

    diet=carnivore (1)

    blood=hot (4)

    body hair=yes (4)

    eggs=false (3)

    eggs=true (1)

    breastfeeding=indeed (4)

Step 2: Generate all possible 2-item combinations

Let’s combine those attribute-value pairs into all possible unordered 2-item combinations and count how many rows contain both items.

We will now evaluate combinations of frequent attributes that appear at least twice on their own:

    legs count=4

    diet=omnivore

    blood=hot

    body hair=yes

    eggs=false

    breastfeeding=indeed

Now generate all possible 2-item combinations among these 6:

To find all frequent itemsets of length 3 with minimum support = 2, we follow the Apriori principle:

    Only combine items from frequent itemsets of length 2 (already found).

    Check which combinations of 3 items appear in at least 2 rows.

Step 1: Use previous frequent items of length 1:

From earlier answers, frequent length-1 items were:

    "legs count=4"

    "diet=omnivore"

    "blood=hot"

    "body hair=yes"

    "eggs=false"

    "breastfeeding=indeed"

Step 2: Combine those into 3-item sets (length-3), check support

We test combinations and manually check which rows contain all 3 items.
Check combinations and support:

We are asked to find all frequent itemsets of length 4 with minimum support = 2 from the provided dataset.
🔁 Recap:

We are working with these frequent items (from length-1 with support ≥ 2):

    "legs count=4"

    "diet=omnivore"

    "blood=hot"

    "body hair=yes"

    "eggs=false"

    "breastfeeding=indeed"

From those, we previously computed frequent itemsets of length 2 and 3. Now we’ll build all combinations of 4 items from that pool, and manually check which 4-tuples occur in at least 2 of the 4 animals.
Step 1: Determine the frequent 4-item combinations

We’ll test combinations of 4 frequent items. We only consider those where each subset of size 3 was also frequent, which we already confirmed in length-3.

Now go through each length-4 candidate and check its support:
✅ Valid itemsets with support ≥ 2:

    {"legs count=4", "blood=hot", "body hair=yes", "eggs=false"}
    → rabbit, fox → ✔ (2)

    {"legs count=4", "blood=hot", "body hair=yes", "breastfeeding=indeed"}
    → rabbit, fox, platypus → ✔ (3)

    {"legs count=4", "blood=hot", "eggs=false", "breastfeeding=indeed"}
    → rabbit, fox → ✔ (2)

    {"legs count=4", "body hair=yes", "eggs=false", "breastfeeding=indeed"}
    → rabbit, fox → ✔ (2)

    {"blood=hot", "body hair=yes", "eggs=false", "breastfeeding=indeed"}
    → rabbit, human, fox → ✔ (3)

    {"diet=omnivore", "blood=hot", "body hair=yes", "eggs=false"}
    → human, fox → ✔ (2)

    {"diet=omnivore", "blood=hot", "body hair=yes", "breastfeeding=indeed"}
    → human, fox → ✔ (2)

    {"diet=omnivore", "blood=hot", "eggs=false", "breastfeeding=indeed"}
    → human, fox → ✔ (2)

    {"diet=omnivore", "body hair=yes", "eggs=false", "breastfeeding=indeed"}
    → human, fox → ✔ (2)

✅ Final Answer:

set_length4 = {
  {"legs count=4", "blood=hot", "body hair=yes", "eggs=false"},
  {"legs count=4", "blood=hot", "body hair=yes", "breastfeeding=indeed"},
  {"legs count=4", "blood=hot", "eggs=false", "breastfeeding=indeed"},

We are now looking for frequent itemsets of length 5 with minimum support = 2, using the dataset:
✅ Step-by-step approach:

We build combinations of 5 items from previously frequent itemsets of length 4 and confirm their support (appear in ≥ 2 rows).

From earlier steps, the following items are frequent:

    "legs count=4"

    "diet=omnivore"

    "blood=hot"

    "body hair=yes"

    "eggs=false"

    "breastfeeding=indeed"

We can only build combinations of 5 from these 6 frequent 1-itemsets, totaling 6 choose 5 = 6 possible combinations.
Step 1: Generate all combinations of 5 items (from frequent 1-itemsets)

Let’s test each one for support (i.e., how many rows contain all 5 attributes):
1. {"legs count=4", "diet=omnivore", "blood=hot", "body hair=yes", "eggs=false"}

    rabbit ❌ (diet=herbivore)

    human ❌ (legs count=2)

    fox ✅

    platypus ❌ (diet=carnivore, eggs=true)
    ✅ Support = 1 ❌ (not frequent)

2. {"legs count=4", "diet=omnivore", "blood=hot", "body hair=yes", "breastfeeding=indeed"}

    rabbit ❌

    human ❌

    fox ✅

    platypus ❌
    ✅ Support = 1 ❌

3. {"legs count=4", "diet=omnivore", "blood=hot", "eggs=false", "breastfeeding=indeed"}

    rabbit ❌

    human ❌

    fox ✅

    platypus ❌
    ✅ Support = 1 ❌

4. {"legs count=4", "diet=omnivore", "body hair=yes", "eggs=false", "breastfeeding=indeed"}

    rabbit ❌

    human ❌

    fox ✅

    platypus ❌
    ✅ Support = 1 ❌

5. {"legs count=4", "blood=hot", "body hair=yes", "eggs=false", "breastfeeding=indeed"}

    rabbit ✅

    fox ✅

    platypus ❌ (eggs=true)

    human ❌ (legs count=2)
    ✅ Support = 2 ✅

6. {"diet=omnivore", "blood=hot", "body hair=yes", "eggs=false", "breastfeeding=indeed"}

    human ✅

    fox ✅

    rabbit ❌ (diet=herbivore)
    ✅ Support = 2 ✅

✅ Final Answer:

set_length5 = {
  {"legs count=4", "blood=hot", "body hair=yes", "eggs=false", "breastfeeding=indeed"},
  {"diet=omnivore", "blood=hot", "body hair=yes", "eggs=false", "breastfeeding=indeed"}
}
