We are given five transactions (rows), each consisting of a set of item codes (like 354C31, B2895C, etc.). Our task is to:

    Find frequent itemsets of length 1 (i.e., individual items).

    An itemset is frequent if it appears in at least 2 transactions (support ≥ 2).

    The output must be of the form:
    set_length_1={{"item1"},{"item2"},...}

Step 1: List All Items Per Transaction

Let’s write down the items per transaction:

T1: 354C31, DBCEEF, 6CE255, 199D26, D59553, 331981, 869F50
T2: B2895C, B0FAAD, 9ED0E8, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999
T3: 1520D1, 49E95E, A6463C, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999
T4: 0BEA8D, B0FAAD, A6463C, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999
T5: 7EA60D, B0FAAD, C5B9CC, D11884, 269963, 420666, 999999
Step 2: Count the Frequency of Each Item

We now tally the number of times each item appears across the transactions:

    354C31: 1

    DBCEEF: 1

    6CE255: 1

    199D26: 1

    D59553: 1

    331981: 1

    869F50: 1

    B2895C: 1

    B0FAAD: 3 ✅

    9ED0E8: 1

    D11884: 4 ✅

    269963: 4 ✅

    ADC8A2: 3 ✅

    999999: 4 ✅

    1520D1: 1

    49E95E: 1

    A6463C: 2 ✅

    0BEA8D: 1

    7EA60D: 1

    C5B9CC: 1

    420666: 1

Step 3: Keep Items with Support ≥ 2

The frequent items are:

    B0FAAD

    D11884

    269963

    ADC8A2

    999999

    A6463C

Step 4: Format Answer as a Set of Sets

We format each as a Python set of strings (length 1 sets):

set_length_1={{"B0FAAD"},{"D11884"},{"269963"},{"ADC8A2"},{"999999"},{"A6463C"}}

✅ Final Answer:

set_length_1={{"B0FAAD"},{"D11884"},{"269963"},{"ADC8A2"},{"999999"},{"A6463C"}}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 2, so set_length_2= {<<itemsets>>}. Instead of placeholder <<itemsets>>, insert the itemsets with corresponding length formatted as python set, all formatted as string; for instance set={{"item 1"},{"item 2"}} without the column names and ().  Consider the first row of the CSV as the name of the columns.

354C31,DBCEEF,6CE255,199D26,D59553,331981,869F50
B2895C,B0FAAD,9ED0E8,D11884,269963,ADC8A2,999999
1520D1,49E95E,A6463C,D11884,269963,ADC8A2,999999

To find all frequent itemsets of length 2 with minimum support = 2, we will follow a manual process, since programming is not allowed.
Step 1: Extract Transactions

Let’s rewrite the transactions more clearly.

T1 = {354C31, DBCEEF, 6CE255, 199D26, D59553, 331981, 869F50}
T2 = {B2895C, B0FAAD, 9ED0E8, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999}
T3 = {1520D1, 49E95E, A6463C, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999}
T4 = {0BEA8D, B0FAAD, A6463C, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999}
T5 = {7EA60D, B0FAAD, C5B9CC, D11884, 269963, 420666, 999999}
Step 2: Identify All Frequent Items (from previous answer)

Only these 6 items had support ≥ 2:

    B0FAAD (3 times)

    D11884 (4 times)

    269963 (4 times)

    ADC8A2 (3 times)

    999999 (4 times)

    A6463C (2 times)

We will now look at all pairs (2-item combinations) from these.
Step 3: Generate All 2-Item Combinations (C(6,2) = 15 combinations)

We will now count in how many transactions each pair appears.

    {B0FAAD, D11884} → T2, T4, T5 ✅ (3)

    {B0FAAD, 269963} → T2, T4, T5 ✅ (3)

    {B0FAAD, ADC8A2} → T2, T4 ✅ (2)

    {B0FAAD, 999999} → T2, T4, T5 ✅ (3)

    {B0FAAD, A6463C} → T4 ✅ (1) ✖️

    {D11884, 269963} → T2, T3, T4, T5 ✅ (4)

    {D11884, ADC8A2} → T2, T3, T4 ✅ (3)

    {D11884, 999999} → T2, T3, T4, T5 ✅ (4)

    {D11884, A6463C} → T3, T4 ✅ (2)

    {269963, ADC8A2} → T2, T3, T4 ✅ (3)

    {269963, 999999} → T2, T3, T4, T5 ✅ (4)

    {269963, A6463C} → T3, T4 ✅ (2)

    {ADC8A2, 999999} → T2, T3, T4 ✅ (3)

    {ADC8A2, A6463C} → T3, T4 ✅ (2)

    {999999, A6463C} → T3, T4 ✅ (2)

Step 4: Keep Only Itemsets with Support ≥ 2

We exclude only:

    {B0FAAD, A6463C} = 1 time ✖️

All other 14 combinations are frequent.
Step 5: Format as Python Sets of Strings

We now write the 14 frequent itemsets of length 2:

set_length_2={{
{"B0FAAD","D11884"},
{"B0FAAD","269963"},
{"B0FAAD","ADC8A2"},
{"B0FAAD","999999"},
{"D11884","269963"},
{"D11884","ADC8A2"},
{"D11884","999999"},
{"D11884","A6463C"},
{"269963","ADC8A2"},
{"269963","999999"},
{"269963","A6463C"},
{"ADC8A2","999999"},
{"ADC8A2","A6463C"},
{"999999","A6463C"}
}}

✅ Final Answer:

set_length_2={{
{"B0FAAD","D11884"},
{"B0FAAD","269963"},
{"B0FAAD","ADC8A2"},
{"B0FAAD","999999"},
{"D11884","269963"},
{"D11884","ADC8A2"},
{"D11884","999999"},
{"D11884","A6463C"},
{"269963","ADC8A2"},
{"269963","999999"},
{"269963","A6463C"},
{"ADC8A2","999999"},
{"ADC8A2","A6463C"},
{"999999","A6463C"}
}}

Find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 3, so set_length_3= {<<itemsets>>}. Instead of placeholder <<itemsets>>, insert the itemsets with corresponding length formatted as python set, all formatted as string; for instance set={{"item 1"},{"item 2"}} without the column names and ().  Consider the first row of the CSV as the name of the columns.

We are asked to find all frequent itemsets of length 3 (i.e., sets of 3 items), with minimum support = 2. As before, we do this manually.
Step 1: List Frequent 1-Itemsets (from earlier steps)

From our previous work, the frequent items (appearing in ≥2 transactions) are:

    B0FAAD

    D11884

    269963

    ADC8A2

    999999

    A6463C

We'll form all 3-item combinations from these 6 items.
Step 2: Generate All 3-Item Combinations

Number of combinations of 6 items taken 3 at a time:
C(6, 3) = 20 combinations

List of all 3-item combinations:

    {B0FAAD, D11884, 269963}

    {B0FAAD, D11884, ADC8A2}

    {B0FAAD, D11884, 999999}

    {B0FAAD, D11884, A6463C}

    {B0FAAD, 269963, ADC8A2}

    {B0FAAD, 269963, 999999}

    {B0FAAD, 269963, A6463C}

    {B0FAAD, ADC8A2, 999999}

    {B0FAAD, ADC8A2, A6463C}

    {B0FAAD, 999999, A6463C}

    {D11884, 269963, ADC8A2}

    {D11884, 269963, 999999}

    {D11884, 269963, A6463C}

    {D11884, ADC8A2, 999999}

    {D11884, ADC8A2, A6463C}

    {D11884, 999999, A6463C}

    {269963, ADC8A2, 999999}

    {269963, ADC8A2, A6463C}

    {269963, 999999, A6463C}

    {ADC8A2, 999999, A6463C}

Step 3: Count Support for Each 3-Itemset

We'll go through each one manually:

    {B0FAAD, D11884, 269963} → T2, T4, T5 ✅ (3)

    {B0FAAD, D11884, ADC8A2} → T2, T4 ✅ (2)

    {B0FAAD, D11884, 999999} → T2, T4, T5 ✅ (3)

    {B0FAAD, D11884, A6463C} → T4 ✅ (1) ✖️

    {B0FAAD, 269963, ADC8A2} → T2, T4 ✅ (2)

    {B0FAAD, 269963, 999999} → T2, T4, T5 ✅ (3)

    {B0FAAD, 269963, A6463C} → T4 ✅ (1) ✖️

    {B0FAAD, ADC8A2, 999999} → T2, T4 ✅ (2)

    {B0FAAD, ADC8A2, A6463C} → T4 ✅ (1) ✖️

    {B0FAAD, 999999, A6463C} → T4 ✅ (1) ✖️

    {D11884, 269963, ADC8A2} → T2, T3, T4 ✅ (3)

    {D11884, 269963, 999999} → T2, T3, T4, T5 ✅ (4)

    {D11884, 269963, A6463C} → T3, T4 ✅ (2)

    {D11884, ADC8A2, 999999} → T2, T3, T4 ✅ (3)

    {D11884, ADC8A2, A6463C} → T3, T4 ✅ (2)

    {D11884, 999999, A6463C} → T3, T4 ✅ (2)

    {269963, ADC8A2, 999999} → T2, T3, T4 ✅ (3)

    {269963, ADC8A2, A6463C} → T3, T4 ✅ (2)

    {269963, 999999, A6463C} → T3, T4 ✅ (2)

    {ADC8A2, 999999, A6463C} → T3, T4 ✅ (2)

Step 4: Keep Only Itemsets with Support ≥ 2

The frequent 3-itemsets (support ≥ 2) are:

    {B0FAAD, D11884, 269963}

    {B0FAAD, D11884, ADC8A2}

    {B0FAAD, D11884, 999999}

    {B0FAAD, 269963, ADC8A2}

    {B0FAAD, 269963, 999999}

    {B0FAAD, ADC8A2, 999999}

    {D11884, 269963, ADC8A2}

    {D11884, 269963, 999999}

    {D11884, 269963, A6463C}

    {D11884, ADC8A2, 999999}

    {D11884, ADC8A2, A6463C}

    {D11884, 999999, A6463C}

    {269963, ADC8A2, 999999}

    {269963, ADC8A2, A6463C}

    {269963, 999999, A6463C}

    {ADC8A2, 999999, A6463C}

We exclude combinations that only appear once (support = 1):
{B0FAAD, D11884, A6463C}, {B0FAAD, 269963, A6463C}, etc.
Step 5: Format Answer as Python Set of Sets

set_length_3={{

We are now looking for frequent itemsets of length 4 with support ≥ 2. Let’s proceed step by step.
✅ Step 1: Known Frequent Items

From earlier answers, these are the only items that appeared in at least 2 transactions:

    B0FAAD

    D11884

    269963

    ADC8A2

    999999

    A6463C

We’ll form all combinations of 4-item sets from these 6.
✅ Step 2: Generate All 4-Item Combinations

Number of combinations = C(6, 4) = 15

All possible 4-itemsets:

    {B0FAAD, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2}

    {B0FAAD, D11884, 269963, 999999}

    {B0FAAD, D11884, 269963, A6463C}

    {B0FAAD, D11884, ADC8A2, 999999}

    {B0FAAD, D11884, ADC8A2, A6463C}

    {269963, ADC8A2, 999999, A6463C}

✅ Step 3: Count Support for Each 4-Itemset (must appear in ≥2 transactions)

We check in which transactions each itemset appears.

Transaction Sets for Reference:

    T2 = {B0FAAD, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999}

    T3 = {A6463C, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999}

    T4 = {B0FAAD, A6463C, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999}

    T5 = {B0FAAD, D11884, 269963, 999999}

Now test each:

    {B0FAAD, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2} → T2, T4 ✅

    {B0FAAD, ADC8A2, 999999, A6463C} → T4 only ✖️

    {D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999} → T2, T3, T4 ✅

    {D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, A6463C} → T3, T4 ✅

    {D11884, 269963, 999999, A6463C} → T3, T4 ✅

Find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 5, so set_length_5= {<<itemsets>>}. Instead of placeholder <<itemsets>>, insert the itemsets with corresponding length formatted as python set, all formatted as string; for instance set={{"item 1"},{"item 2"}} without the column names and ().  Consider the first row of the CSV as the name of the columns.

We are asked to find all frequent itemsets of length 5 (5-item combinations) with support ≥ 2, using the given transactions, and without programming.
✅ Step 1: Known Frequent Items

From previous steps, the 6 items that appear in at least 2 transactions are:

    B0FAAD

    D11884

    269963

    ADC8A2

    999999

    A6463C

From these, generate 5-item combinations.
✅ Step 2: Generate All 5-Item Combinations

C(6, 5) = 6 combinations.

Here they are:

    {B0FAAD, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999}

    {B0FAAD, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, A6463C}

    {B0FAAD, D11884, 269963, 999999, A6463C}

    {B0FAAD, D11884, ADC8A2, 999999, A6463C}

    {B0FAAD, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999, A6463C}

    {D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999, A6463C}

✅ Step 3: Check Which Transactions Contain Each 5-Itemset

Let’s analyze the 4 relevant transactions (T2 to T5):

    T2 = {B0FAAD, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999}

    T3 = {A6463C, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999}

    T4 = {B0FAAD, A6463C, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999}

    T5 = {B0FAAD, D11884, 269963, 999999}

Now check:

    {B0FAAD, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999}
    → Present in T2 and T4 ✅ (Support = 2)

    {B0FAAD, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, A6463C}
    → Present only in T4 ✖️

    {B0FAAD, D11884, 269963, 999999, A6463C}
    → Present only in T4 ✖️

    {B0FAAD, D11884, ADC8A2, 999999, A6463C}
    → Present only in T4 ✖️

    {B0FAAD, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999, A6463C}
    → Present only in T4 ✖️

    {D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999, A6463C}
    → Present in T3 and T4 ✅ (Support = 2)

✅ Step 4: Keep Frequent Itemsets (support ≥ 2)

Frequent 5-itemsets:

    {B0FAAD, D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999}

    {D11884, 269963, ADC8A2, 999999, A6463C}

✅ Step 5: Format as Python Set of Sets

set_length_5={{
{"B0FAAD","D11884","269963","ADC8A2","999999"},
{"D11884","269963","ADC8A2","999999","A6463C"}
}}

✅ Final Answer:

set_length_5={{
{"B0FAAD","D11884","269963","ADC8A2","999999"},
{"D11884","269963","ADC8A2","999999","A6463C"}
}}
