To solve this manually (without programming), we follow these steps:
Step 1: List all transactions

Each row is a transaction containing items.

    {354, 312, 624, 199, 359, 331, 869}

    {128, 105, 943, 311, 269, 032, 999}

    {152, 494, 064, 311, 269, 032, 999}

    {014, 105, 064, 311, 269, 032, 999}

    {740, 105, 251, 311, 269, 420, 999}

Step 2: Count frequency of each individual item (support count)

Let’s tally each item across all transactions:

    354 → 1

    312 → 1

    624 → 1

    199 → 1

    359 → 1

    331 → 1

    869 → 1

    128 → 1

    105 → 3 (transactions 2, 4, 5) ✅

    943 → 1

    311 → 4 ✅

    269 → 4 ✅

    032 → 3 ✅

    999 → 4 ✅

    152 → 1

    494 → 1

    064 → 2 ✅

    014 → 1

    740 → 1

    251 → 1

    420 → 1

Step 3: Filter items with support ≥ 2

These items are frequent:

    105 (3 times)

    311 (4 times)

    269 (4 times)

    032 (3 times)

    999 (4 times)

    064 (2 times)

Step 4: Format the output

As per instructions: set={{"item 1"},{"item 2"}}

set={{"105"},{"311"},{"269"},{"032"},{"999"},{"064"}}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 2, so set_length_2= {<<itemsets>>}. Instead of placeholder <<itemsets>>, insert the itemsets with corresponding length formatted as python set, all formatted as string; for instance set={{"item 1"},{"item 2"}} without the column names and (). Consider the first row of the CSV as the name of the columns.

We are looking for frequent itemsets of length 2 (i.e., pairs of items) that appear in at least 2 transactions.
Step 1: List the transactions clearly

    {354, 312, 624, 199, 359, 331, 869}

    {128, 105, 943, 311, 269, 032, 999}

    {152, 494, 064, 311, 269, 032, 999}

    {014, 105, 064, 311, 269, 032, 999}

    {740, 105, 251, 311, 269, 420, 999}

Step 2: Find all pairs (length-2 itemsets) and their support

We only consider itemsets that appear in 2 or more transactions.

We'll focus only on the items that appeared frequently in the previous task (they're most likely to form frequent pairs):

From earlier, frequent items:
105, 311, 269, 032, 999, 064

Now let's generate all possible pairs among these:

    (105, 311)

    (105, 269)

    (105, 032)

    (105, 999)

    (105, 064)

    (311, 269)

    (311, 032)

    (311, 999)

    (311, 064)

    (269, 032)

    (269, 999)

    (269, 064)

    (032, 999)

    (032, 064)

    (999, 064)

Now check in how many transactions each pair appears:
Pair (105, 311)

→ Appears in transactions 2, 4, 5 → ✅ support = 3
Pair (105, 269)

→ Appears in transactions 2, 4, 5 → ✅ support = 3
Pair (105, 032)

→ Appears in transactions 2, 4 → ✅ support = 2
Pair (105, 999)

→ Appears in transactions 2, 4, 5 → ✅ support = 3
Pair (105, 064)

→ Appears in transactions 4 → support = 1 ❌
Pair (311, 269)

→ Appears in transactions 2, 3, 4, 5 → ✅ support = 4
Pair (311, 032)

→ Appears in transactions 2, 3, 4 → ✅ support = 3
Pair (311, 999)

→ Appears in transactions 2, 3, 4, 5 → ✅ support = 4
Pair (311, 064)

→ Appears in transactions 3, 4 → ✅ support = 2
Pair (269, 032)

→ Appears in transactions 2, 3, 4 → ✅ support = 3
Pair (269, 999)

→ Appears in transactions 2, 3, 4, 5 → ✅ support = 4
Pair (269, 064)

→ Appears in transactions 3, 4 → ✅ support = 2
Pair (032, 999)

→ Appears in transactions 2, 3, 4 → ✅ support = 3
Pair (032, 064)

→ Appears in transactions 3, 4 → ✅ support = 2
Pair (999, 064)

→ Appears in transactions 3, 4 → ✅ support = 2
Step 3: Format all frequent itemsets of length 2 with support ≥ 2

Frequent itemsets of length 2 (as sets) are:

set={{"105","311"},{"105","269"},{"105","032"},{"105","999"},{"311","269"},{"311","032"},{"311","999"},{"311","064"},{"269","032"},{"269","999"},{"269","064"},{"032","999"},{"032","064"},{"999","064"}}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 3, so set_length_3= {<<itemsets>>}. Instead of placeholder <<itemsets>>, insert the itemsets with corresponding length formatted as python set, all formatted as string; for instance set={{"item 1"},{"item 2"}} without the column names and (). Consider the first row of the CSV as the name of the columns.

We are now looking for frequent itemsets of length 3 (triplets of items) with support ≥ 2.
Step 1: Use the frequent items from earlier

From previous steps, the frequent items (support ≥ 2) are:

105, 311, 269, 032, 999, 064

We'll generate all combinations of 3 items from these 6:

Total combinations (without repetition) = 6C3 = 20
Step 2: List all 3-item combinations

    (105, 311, 269)

    (105, 311, 032)

    (105, 311, 999)

    (105, 311, 064)

    (105, 269, 032)

    (105, 269, 999)

    (105, 269, 064)

    (105, 032, 999)

    (105, 032, 064)

    (105, 999, 064)

    (311, 269, 032)

    (311, 269, 999)

    (311, 269, 064)

    (311, 032, 999)

    (311, 032, 064)

    (311, 999, 064)

    (269, 032, 999)

    (269, 032, 064)

    (269, 999, 064)

    (032, 999, 064)

Step 3: Check support (count how many transactions each appears in)

We'll go through transactions 2–5 (only these contain the frequent items):
Transaction 2: {128, 105, 943, 311, 269, 032, 999}

→ includes: 105, 311, 269, 032, 999
Transaction 3: {152, 494, 064, 311, 269, 032, 999}

→ includes: 064, 311, 269, 032, 999
Transaction 4: {014, 105, 064, 311, 269, 032, 999}

→ includes: 105, 064, 311, 269, 032, 999
Transaction 5: {740, 105, 251, 311, 269, 420, 999}

→ includes: 105, 311, 269, 999

Now, manually check which triplets appear in at least 2 of those 4 transactions:

    (105, 311, 269) → in T2, T4, T5 → ✅

    (105, 311, 032) → in T2, T4 → ✅

    (269, 999, 064) → in T3, T4 → ✅

    (032, 999, 064) → in T3, T4 → ✅

Step 4: Final list of frequent length-3 itemsets (support ≥ 2)

set={{"105","311","269"},{"105","311","032"},{"105","311","999"},{"105","269","032"},{"105","269","999"},{"105","032","999"},{"311","269","032"},{"311","269","999"},{"311","269","064"},{"311","032","999"},{"311","032","064"},{"311","999","064"},{"269","032","999"},{"269","032","064"},{"269","999","064"},{"032","999","064"}}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 4, so set_length_4= {<<itemsets>>}. Instead of placeholder <<itemsets>>, insert the itemsets with corresponding length formatted as python set, all formatted as string; for instance set={{"item 1"},{"item 2"}} without the column names and (). Consider the first row of the CSV as the name of the columns.

We now need to find all frequent itemsets of length 4 (i.e., 4-item combinations) with support ≥ 2 from the dataset of transactions.
Step 1: Recall frequent items

From previous answers, the frequent items (support ≥ 2) are:

105, 311, 269, 032, 999, 064

From these 6 items, we find all combinations of 4 elements (6C4 = 15 combinations).
Step 2: List all 4-item combinations of frequent items

    (105, 311, 269, 032)

    (105, 311, 269, 999)

    (105, 311, 269, 064)

    (311, 032, 999, 064)

    (269, 032, 999, 064)

Step 3: Check support (manually across transactions 2–5)

Summarized contents:

    T2 → {105, 311, 269, 032, 999}

    T3 → {311, 269, 032, 999, 064}

We now need to find all frequent itemsets of length 5 (i.e., 5-item combinations) with support ≥ 2, from the transactions.
Step 1: Frequent items to consider

From previous steps, we know the frequent items are:

105, 311, 269, 032, 999, 064

We form all 5-item combinations from these 6.

Number of combinations = 6C5 = 6
Step 2: List all possible 5-item combinations

    (105, 311, 269, 032, 999)

    (105, 311, 269, 032, 064)

    (105, 311, 269, 999, 064)

    (105, 311, 032, 999, 064)

    (105, 269, 032, 999, 064)

    (311, 269, 032, 999, 064)

Step 3: Check in which transactions each appears
Transaction summaries:

    T2 → {105, 311, 269, 032, 999}

    T3 → {311, 269, 032, 999, 064}

    T4 → {105, 311, 269, 032, 999, 064}

    T5 → {105, 311, 269, 999}

Now evaluate each candidate:

    (105, 311, 269, 032, 999)
    → Appears in T2 and T4 → ✅

    (105, 311, 269, 032, 064)
    → Only in T4 → ✖

    (105, 311, 269, 999, 064)
    → Only in T4 → ✖

    (105, 311, 032, 999, 064)
    → Only in T4 → ✖

    (105, 269, 032, 999, 064)
    → Only in T4 → ✖

    (311, 269, 032, 999, 064)
    → In T3 and T4 → ✅

Step 4: Final answer — frequent itemsets of length 5 with support ≥ 2

set={{"105","311","269","032","999"},{"311","269","032","999","064"}}
