Find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 1, so set_length_1= {<<itemsets>>}. Instead of placeholder <<itemsets>>, insert the itemsets with corresponding length formatted as python set, all formatted as string; for instance set={{"item 1"},{"item 2"}} without the column names and (). Consider the first row of the CSV as the name of the columns.

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 1, we need to identify the individual items (or attributes) that appear at least twice in the dataset. Since we're not considering combinations of items (as length is 1), we'll look at each attribute individually.

Given the dataset:

    name: rabbit, human, fox, platypus
    legs count: 6, 4, 6, 6
    diet: carnivore, herbivore, herbivore, omnivore
    blood: cold, cold, cold, cold
    body hair: no, no, no, no
    eggs: true, true, true, false
    breastfeeding: negative, negative, negative, negative

Let's identify the frequent itemsets with support ≥ 2:

    For "legs count": {6} appears 3 times.
    For "diet": {herbivore} appears 2 times.
    For "blood": {cold} appears 4 times.
    For "body hair": {no} appears 4 times.
    For "eggs": {true} appears 3 times.
    For "breastfeeding": {negative} appears 4 times.

Therefore, the set of frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 1 is:

set_length_1 = {{"6"},{"herbivore"},{"cold"},{"no"},{"true"},{"negative"}}

Find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 2, so set_length_2= {<<itemsets>>}. Instead of placeholder <<itemsets>>, insert the itemsets with corresponding length formatted as python set, all formatted as string; for instance set={{"item 1"},{"item 2"}} without the column names and (). Consider the first row of the CSV as the name of the columns.

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 2, we need to identify the combinations of two items (or attributes) that appear at least twice in the dataset.

Given the dataset:

    name: rabbit, human, fox, platypus
    legs count: 6, 4, 6, 6
    diet: carnivore, herbivore, herbivore, omnivore
    blood: cold, cold, cold, cold
    body hair: no, no, no, no
    eggs: true, true, true, false
    breastfeeding: negative, negative, negative, negative

Let's identify the frequent itemsets with support ≥ 2:

    {"6", "cold"} appears 3 times (rabbit, fox, platypus)
    {"6", "no"} appears 3 times (rabbit, fox, platypus)
    {"6", "negative"} appears 3 times (rabbit, fox, platypus)
    {"herbivore", "cold"} appears 2 times (human, fox)
    {"herbivore", "no"} appears 2 times (human, fox)
    {"herbivore", "true"} appears 2 times (human, fox)
    {"herbivore", "negative"} appears 2 times (human, fox)
    {"cold", "no"} appears 4 times (all rows)
    {"cold", "negative"} appears 4 times (all rows)
    {"no", "negative"} appears 4 times (all rows)
    {"true", "negative"} appears 3 times (rabbit, human, fox)

Therefore, the set of frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 2 is:

set_length_2 = {{"6", "cold"},{"6", "no"},{"6", "negative"},{"herbivore", "cold"},{"herbivore", "no"},{"herbivore", "true"},{"herbivore", "negative"},{"cold", "no"},{"cold", "negative"},{"no", "negative"},{"true", "negative"}}

Find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 3, so set_length_3= {<<itemsets>>}. Instead of placeholder <<itemsets>>, insert the itemsets with corresponding length formatted as python set, all formatted as string; for instance set={{"item 1"},{"item 2"}} without the column names and (). Consider the first row of the CSV as the name of the columns.

    {"herbivore", "no", "true"} appears 2 times (human, fox)
    {"herbivore", "no", "negative"} appears 2 times (human, fox)
    {"herbivore", "true", "negative"} appears 2 times (human, fox)

    {"cold", "true", "negative"} appears 3 times (rabbit, human, fox)
    {"no", "true", "negative"} appears 3 times (rabbit, human, fox)

Therefore, the set of frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 3 is:
