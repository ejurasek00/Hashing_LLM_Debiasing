To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 1, we need to identify the items that appear at least twice in the dataset.

Let's analyze the dataset:

    354 appears only once
    312 appears only once
    624 appears only once
    199 appears only once
    359 appears only once
    331 appears only once
    869 appears only once
    128 appears only once
    105 appears 3 times
    943 appears only once
    311 appears 4 times
    269 appears 4 times
    032 appears 3 times
    999 appears 4 times
    152 appears only once
    494 appears only once
    064 appears 2 times
    014 appears only once
    740 appears only once
    251 appears only once
    420 appears only once

The items that appear at least twice are:

    105 (3 times)
    311 (4 times)
    269 (4 times)
    032 (3 times)
    999 (4 times)
    064 (2 times)

Therefore, the frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 1 are:

set_length_1 = {{"105"},{"311"},{"269"},{"032"},{"999"},{"064"}}

Find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 2, so set_length_2= {<<itemsets>>}. Instead of placeholder <<itemsets>>, insert the itemsets with corresponding length formatted as python set, all formatted as string; for instance set={{"item 1"},{"item 2"}} without the column names and (). Consider the first row of the CSV as the name of the columns.

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 2, we need to identify the pairs of items that appear together at least twice in the dataset.

Let's analyze the dataset:

    (105, 311) appears 3 times
    (105, 269) appears 3 times
    (105, 032) appears 3 times
    (105, 999) appears 3 times
    (311, 269) appears 4 times
    (311, 032) appears 3 times
    (311, 999) appears 4 times
    (269, 032) appears 3 times
    (269, 999) appears 4 times
    (032, 999) appears 3 times
    (064, 311) appears 2 times
    (064, 269) appears 2 times
    (064, 032) appears 2 times
    (064, 999) appears 2 times

The pairs of items that appear together at least twice are:

set_length_2 = {{"105, 311"},{"105, 269"},{"105, 032"},{"105, 999"},{"311, 269"},{"311, 032"},{"311, 999"},{"269, 032"},{"269, 999"},{"032, 999"},{"064, 311"},{"064, 269"},{"064, 032"},{"064, 999"}}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 3, so set_length_3= {<<itemsets>>}. Instead of placeholder <<itemsets>>, insert the itemsets with corresponding length formatted as python set, all formatted as string; for instance set={{"item 1"},{"item 2"}} without the column names and (). Consider the first row of the CSV as the name of the columns.

The triplets of items that appear together at least twice are:

set_length_3 = {{"105, 311, 269"},{"105, 311, 032"},{"105, 311, 999"},{"105, 269, 032"},{"105, 269, 999"},{"105, 032, 999"},{"311, 269, 032"},{"311, 269, 999"},{"311, 032, 999"},{"269, 032, 999"},{"064, 311, 269"},{"064, 311, 032"},{"064, 311, 999"},{"064, 269, 032"},{"064, 269, 999"},{"064, 032, 999"}}

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 4, we need to identify the quadruplets of items that appear together at least twice in the dataset.

Let's analyze the dataset:

    (105, 311, 269, 032) appears 3 times

The quadruplets of items that appear together at least twice are:
