To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 1, we need to identify the items that appear at least twice in the dataset.

Let's count the occurrences of each item:

    354C31: 1
    DBCEEF: 1
    6CE255: 1
    199D26: 1
    D59553: 1
    331981: 1
    869F50: 1
    B2895C: 1
    B0FAAD: 3
    9ED0E8: 1
    D11884: 4
    269963: 4
    ADC8A2: 4
    999999: 4
    1520D1: 1
    49E95E: 1
    A6463C: 2
    0BEA8D: 1
    7EA60D: 1
    C5B9CC: 1
    420666: 1

The items that appear at least twice are:

    B0FAAD: 3
    D11884: 4
    269963: 4
    ADC8A2: 4
    999999: 4
    A6463C: 2

The frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 1 are:

set_length_1 = {{"B0FAAD"},{"D11884"},{"269963"},{"ADC8A2"},{"999999"},{"A6463C"}}

Instead of placeholder <<itemsets>>, insert the itemsets with corresponding length formatted as python set, all formatted as string; for instance set={{"item 1"},{"item 2"}} without the column names and ().

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 2, we need to identify the pairs of items that appear together at least twice in the dataset.

Let's analyze the dataset:

    B0FAAD and D11884 appear together in rows 2, 4, and 5
    B0FAAD and 269963 appear together in rows 2, 4, and 5
    B0FAAD and ADC8A2 appear together in rows 2, 4, and 5

    D11884 and ADC8A2 appear together in rows 2, 3, 4, and 5

    A6463C and 269963 appear together in rows 3 and 4
    A6463C and ADC8A2 appear together in rows 3 and 4
    A6463C and 999999 appear together in rows 3 and 4

The frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 2 are:

set_length_2 = {{"B0FAAD", "D11884"}, {"B0FAAD", "269963"}, {"B0FAAD", "ADC8A2"}, {"B0FAAD", "999999"}, {"D11884", "269963"}, {"D11884", "ADC8A2"}, {"D11884", "999999"}, {"269963", "ADC8A2"}, {"269963", "999999"}, {"ADC8A2", "999999"}, {"A6463C", "D11884"}, {"A6463C", "269963"}, {"A6463C", "ADC8A2"}, {"A6463C", "999999"}}
