Find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 1, so set_length1= {<<itemsets>>}.

LLAMA

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 1, we need to identify the items that appear at least twice in each column.

Here are the results:

    name: Not applicable (unique names)
    legs count: {{"4"}}
    diet: {{"omnivore"}}
    blood: {{"hot"}}
    body hair: {{"yes"}}
    eggs: {{"false"}}
    breastfeeding: {{"indeed"}}

So, the set_length1 is:

set_length1 = {{"4"},{"omnivore"},{"hot"},{"yes"},{"false"},{"indeed"}}

Find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 2, so set_length2= {<<itemsets>>}. Instead of placeholder <<itemsets>>, insert the itemsets with corresponding length formatted as python set, all formatted as string; for instance set={{"item 1"},{"item 2"}} without the column names and (). Consider the first row of the CSV as the name of the columns.

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 2, we need to identify the combinations of two items that appear at least twice.

Here are the results:

    (legs count, diet): {{"4", "omnivore"}}
    (diet, blood): {{"omnivore", "hot"}}
    (blood, body hair): {{"hot", "yes"}}
    (body hair, eggs): {{"yes", "false"}}
    (eggs, breastfeeding): {{"false", "indeed"}}
    (legs count, blood): {{"4", "hot"}}
    (legs count, body hair): {{"4", "yes"}}
    (legs count, eggs): {{"4", "false"}}
    (legs count, breastfeeding): {{"4", "indeed"}}
    (diet, body hair): {{"omnivore", "yes"}}
    (diet, eggs): {{"omnivore", "false"}}
    (diet, breastfeeding): {{"omnivore", "indeed"}}
    (blood, eggs): {{"hot", "false"}}
    (blood, breastfeeding): {{"hot", "indeed"}}
    (body hair, breastfeeding): {{"yes", "indeed"}}

So, the set_length2 is:

set_length2 = {{"4", "omnivore"},{"omnivore", "hot"},{"hot", "yes"},{"yes", "false"},{"false", "indeed"},{"4", "hot"},{"4", "yes"},{"4", "false"},{"4", "indeed"},{"omnivore", "yes"},{"omnivore", "false"},{"omnivore", "indeed"},{"hot", "false"},{"hot", "indeed"},{"yes", "indeed"}}

Find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 3, so set_length3= {<<itemsets>>}. Instead of placeholder <<itemsets>>, insert the itemsets with corresponding length formatted as python set, all formatted as string; for instance set={{"item 1"},{"item 2"}} without the column names and (). Consider the first row of the CSV as the name of the columns.

LLAMA

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 3, we need to identify the combinations of three items that appear at least twice.

Here are the results:

    (legs count, diet, blood): {{"4", "omnivore", "hot"}}
    (diet, blood, body hair): {{"omnivore", "hot", "yes"}}
    (blood, body hair, eggs): {{"hot", "yes", "false"}}
    (body hair, eggs, breastfeeding): {{"yes", "false", "indeed"}}
    (legs count, blood, body hair): {{"4", "hot", "yes"}}
    (legs count, body hair, eggs): {{"4", "yes", "false"}}
    (legs count, eggs, breastfeeding): {{"4", "false", "indeed"}}
    (diet, body hair, breastfeeding): {{"omnivore", "yes", "indeed"}}
    (blood, eggs, breastfeeding): {{"hot", "false", "indeed"}}
    (legs count, blood, breastfeeding): {{"4", "hot", "indeed"}}
    (legs count, diet, body hair): {{"4", "omnivore", "yes"}}
    (legs count, diet, eggs): {{"4", "omnivore", "false"}}
    (legs count, diet, breastfeeding): {{"4", "omnivore", "indeed"}}
    (diet, blood, eggs): {{"omnivore", "hot", "false"}}
    (diet, blood, breastfeeding): {{"omnivore", "hot", "indeed"}}
    (blood, body hair, breastfeeding): {{"hot", "yes", "indeed"}}

However, not all of these combinations meet the minimal support requirement of 2. After re-examining the data, we can see that the following combinations meet the requirement:

    (legs count, blood, body hair): {{"4", "hot", "yes"}}
    (blood, body hair, breastfeeding): {{"hot", "yes", "indeed"}}
    (legs count, blood, breastfeeding): {{"4", "hot", "indeed"}}
    (blood, body hair, eggs): {{"hot", "yes", "false"}}
    (body hair, eggs, breastfeeding): {{"yes", "false", "indeed"}}
    (legs count, body hair, eggs): {{"4", "yes", "false"}}
    (legs count, eggs, breastfeeding): {{"4", "false", "indeed"}}
    (blood, eggs, breastfeeding): {{"hot", "false", "indeed"}}

So, the set_length3 is:

set_length3 = {{"4", "hot", "yes"},{"hot", "yes", "indeed"},{"4", "hot", "indeed"},{"hot", "yes", "false"},{"yes", "false", "indeed"},{"4", "yes", "false"},{"4", "false", "indeed"},{"hot", "false", "indeed"}}

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 4, we need to identify the combinations of four items that appear at least twice.

Here are the results:

    (legs count, blood, eggs, breastfeeding): {{"4", "hot", "false", "indeed"}}

    (legs count, blood, eggs, breastfeeding): {{"4", "hot", "false", "indeed"}}
    (blood, body hair, eggs, breastfeeding): {{"hot", "yes", "false", "indeed"}}

So, the set_length4 is:

set_length4 = {{"4", "hot", "yes", "false"},{"4", "hot", "yes", "indeed"},{"4", "hot", "false", "indeed"},{"hot", "yes", "false", "indeed"}}
