To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 1, we need to identify the items that appear at least twice in the dataset.

Let's analyze the dataset:

    354C31 appears only once
    DBCEEF appears only once
    6CE255 appears only once
    199D26 appears only once
    D59553 appears only once
    331981 appears only once
    869F50 appears only once
    B2895C appears only once
    B0FAAD appears 3 times
    9ED0E8 appears only once
    D11884 appears 4 times
    269963 appears 4 times
    ADC8A2 appears 4 times
    999999 appears 4 times
    1520D1 appears only once

    0BEA8D appears only once
    7EA60D appears only once
    C5B9CC appears only once
    420666 appears only once

The frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 1 are:
