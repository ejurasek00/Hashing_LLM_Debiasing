To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 1, we need to identify the items that appear at least twice in the dataset.

Let's analyze the dataset:

    354,312,624,199,359,331,869
    128,105,943,311,269,032,999
    152,494,064,311,269,032,999
    014,105,064,311,269,032,999
    740,105,251,311,269,420,999

We can see that the following items appear at least twice:

    105 (appears in rows 2, 4, and 5)
    311 (appears in rows 2, 3, 4, and 5)
    269 (appears in rows 2, 3, 4, and 5)
    032 (appears in rows 2, 3, and 4)
    999 (appears in rows 2, 3, 4, and 5)

Therefore, the frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 1 are:

set_length_1 = {{"105"},{"311"},{"269"},{"032"},{"999"}}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 2, so set_length_2= {<<itemsets>>}. Instead of placeholder <<itemsets>>, insert the itemsets with corresponding length formatted as python set, all formatted as string; for instance set={{"item 1"},{"item 2"}} without the column names and (). Consider the first row of the CSV as the name of the columns.

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 2, we need to identify the pairs of items that appear together at least twice in the dataset.

Let's analyze the dataset:

    354,312,624,199,359,331,869
    128,105,943,311,269,032,999

    014,105,064,311,269,032,999
    740,105,251,311,269,420,999

We can see that the following pairs of items appear together at least twice:

    105, 311 (appears in rows 2, 4, and 5)
    105, 269 (appears in rows 2, 4, and 5)
    105, 032 (appears in rows 2 and 4)
    105, 999 (appears in rows 2, 4, and 5)
    311, 269 (appears in rows 2, 3, 4, and 5)
    311, 032 (appears in rows 2, 3, and 4)
    311, 999 (appears in rows 2, 3, 4, and 5)
    269, 032 (appears in rows 2, 3, and 4)
    269, 999 (appears in rows 2, 3, 4, and 5)
    032, 999 (appears in rows 2, 3, and 4)

Therefore, the frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 2 are:

set_length_2 = {{"105","311"},{"105","269"},{"105","032"},{"105","999"},{"311","269"},{"311","032"},{"311","999"},{"269","032"},{"269","999"},{"032","999"}}

Find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 3, so set_length_3= {<<itemsets>>}. Instead of placeholder <<itemsets>>, insert the itemsets with corresponding length formatted as python set, all formatted as string; for instance set={{"item 1"},{"item 2"}} without the column names and (). Consider the first row of the CSV as the name of the columns.

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 3, we need to identify the triples of items that appear together at least twice in the dataset.

Let's analyze the dataset:

    354,312,624,199,359,331,869
    128,105,943,311,269,032,999

    740,105,251,311,269,420,999

We can see that the following triples of items appear together at least twice:

    105, 311, 269 (appears in rows 2, 4, and 5)
    105, 311, 032 (appears in rows 2 and 4)
    105, 311, 999 (appears in rows 2, 4, and 5)
    105, 269, 032 (appears in rows 2 and 4)
    105, 269, 999 (appears in rows 2, 4, and 5)

    311, 032, 999 (appears in rows 2, 3, and 4)
    269, 032, 999 (appears in rows 2, 3, and 4)

Therefore, the frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 3 are:

set_length_3 = {{"105","311","269"},{"105","311","032"},{"105","311","999"},{"105","269","032"},{"105","269","999"},{"311","269","032"},{"311","269","999"},{"311","032","999"},{"269","032","999"}}

Find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 4, so set_length_4= {<<itemsets>>}.

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 4, we need to identify the quadruples of items that appear together at least twice in the dataset.

Let's analyze the dataset:

    354,312,624,199,359,331,869
    128,105,943,311,269,032,999

    740,105,251,311,269,420,999

We can see that the following quadruples of items appear together at least twice:

    105, 311, 269, 032 (appears in rows 2 and 4)
    105, 311, 269, 999 (appears in rows 2, 4, and 5)
    311, 269, 032, 999 (appears in rows 2, 3, and 4)

Therefore, the frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 4 are:

set_length_4 = {{"105","311","269","032"},{"105","311","269","999"},{"311","269","032","999"}}

Find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 5, so set_length_5= {<<itemsets>>}. Instead of placeholder <<itemsets>>, insert the itemsets with corresponding length formatted as python set, all formatted as string; for instance set={{"item 1"},{"item 2"}} without the column names and ().

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 5, we need to identify the quintuples of items that appear together at least twice in the dataset.

Let's analyze the dataset:

    354,312,624,199,359,331,869
    128,105,943,311,269,032,999
    152,494,064,311,269,032,999
    014,105,064,311,269,032,999
    740,105,251,311,269,420,999

We can see that there is no quintuple of items that appears together at least twice in the dataset, except for one case:

    105, 311, 269, 032, 999 does not appear together in at least 2 rows with the same 5 items, row 2 has a 943 and row 4 has a 064, row 3 has a 494 and row 5 has a 251 and 420 instead of 032.

However row 2 and 4 do not have the same quintuple, but row 3 and 4 have 311, 269, 032 in common with row 2, but not the full quintuple.

However looking at the data again, there is one case of a quintuple itemset.

311, 269, 032, 999 appears in row 2 and 3 and also in row 4 105 also appears, hence:

105, 311, 269, 032, 999 appears in row 2 and 4.

Therefore, the frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 5 are:

set_length_5 = {{"105","311","269","032","999"}}
