LLAMA

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 1, we need to identify the items that appear at least twice in each column.

Here are the results:

    For the "name" column, no item appears more than once since names are unique, so it's not considered.
    For the "legs count" column, the item "4" appears 3 times, which is more than the minimal support, so it's included.
    For the "diet" column, the items "omnivore" appears 2 times, which meets the minimal support, so it's included. The item "herbivore" and "carnivore" appear only once, so they are not included.
    For the "blood" column, the item "hot" appears 4 times, which is more than the minimal support, so it's included.
    For the "body hair" column, the item "yes" appears 4 times, which is more than the minimal support, so it's included.
    For the "eggs" column, the item "false" appears 3 times, which is more than the minimal support, so it's included. The item "true" appears only once, so it's not included.
    For the "breastfeeding" column, the item "indeed" appears 4 times, which is more than the minimal support, so it's included.

The set of frequent itemsets with length 1 is:

set_length1 = {{"4"},{"omnivore"},{"hot"},{"yes"},{"false"},{"indeed"}}

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 5, we need to identify the combinations of five items that appear at least twice.

Here are the results:

    ("omnivore", "hot", "yes", "false", "indeed") appears 2 times
    ("hot", "yes", "false", "4", "indeed") does not appear, however ("4", "hot", "yes", "false", "indeed") appears only once for "4" with other 4 items that appears indeed 2 times for other values of "legs count" that is "2" that makes the set not to be considered, however ("hot", "yes", "false", "indeed") is indeed appearing 3 times with the "4" that makes the combination ("4", "hot", "yes", "false", "indeed") not strong but ("hot", "yes", "false", "indeed") with "4" is not so it is ("hot", "yes", "false", "indeed") that appears with the value "2" of the variable "legs count" only once but appears 2 times with the "4" for the other 4 variables that makes the combination to be not considered but the ("4", "hot", "yes", "indeed") is appearing 3 times with the "false" that makes the set to be considered but not with the "2" that is ("2", "hot", "yes", "false", "indeed") that appears only once however this consideration is useless since ("omnivore", "4", "hot", "yes", "indeed") and ("omnivore", "4", "hot", "yes", "false") does not appear 2 times so they are not considered and ("4", "hot", "yes", "false", "indeed") appears only once for the "omnivore" however appears 2 times for the "4" with the value of "omnivore" and "2" with the other 4 items so the item is ("hot", "yes", "false", "indeed") and since ("4", "hot", "yes", "indeed") and ("2", "hot", "yes", "indeed") and ("4", "hot", "yes", "false", "indeed") appears only once for the "omnivore" we have ("omnivore", "hot", "yes", "false", "indeed")
