LLAMA

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 1, we need to identify the items that appear at least twice in each column.

Here are the results:

    name: {"human", "fox", "rabbit", "platypus"} (all appear only once, so no frequent itemsets)
    legs count: {6} (appears 3 times), {4} (appears only once)
    diet: {"herbivore"} (appears 2 times), {"carnivore", "omnivore"} (appear only once)
    blood: {"cold"} (appears 4 times)
    body hair: {"no"} (appears 4 times)
    eggs: {"true"} (appears 3 times), {"false"} (appears only once)
    breastfeeding: {"negative"} (appears 4 times)

The set of frequent itemsets with length 1 is:

set_length_1 = {{"6"},{"herbivore"},{"cold"},{"no"},{"true"},{"negative"}}
