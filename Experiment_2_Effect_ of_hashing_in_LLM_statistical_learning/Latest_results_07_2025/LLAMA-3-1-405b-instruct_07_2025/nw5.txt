LLAMA

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 1, we need to identify the items that appear at least twice in each column.

Let's analyze each column:

    name: Each name is unique, so there are no frequent itemsets in this column.
    legs count: 6 appears three times, so {6} is a frequent itemset.
    diet: There is no diet that appears more than once.
    blood: "cold" appears four times, so {"cold"} is a frequent itemset.
    body hair: "no" appears four times, so {"no"} is a frequent itemset.
    eggs: "true" appears three times, so {"true"} is a frequent itemset.
    breastfeeding: "negative" appears four times, so {"negative"} is a frequent itemset.

Therefore, the set of frequent itemsets with length 1 is:

set_length_1 = {{"6"},{"cold"},{"no"},{"true"},{"negative"}}

Find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 2, so set_length_2= {<<itemsets>>}. Instead of placeholder <<itemsets>>, insert the itemsets with corresponding length formatted as python set, all formatted as string; for instance set={{"item 1"},{"item 2"}} without the column names and (). Consider the first row of the CSV as the name of the columns.

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 2, we need to identify the combinations of two items that appear at least twice.

Let's analyze the combinations:

    (legs count, blood): (6, cold) appears three times, so {"6", "cold"} is a frequent itemset.
    (legs count, body hair): (6, no) appears three times, so {"6", "no"} is a frequent itemset.
    (legs count, breastfeeding): (6, negative) appears three times, so {"6", "negative"} is a frequent itemset.
    (blood, body hair): (cold, no) appears four times, so {"cold", "no"} is a frequent itemset.
    (blood, breastfeeding): (cold, negative) appears four times, so {"cold", "negative"} is a frequent itemset.
    (body hair, breastfeeding): (no, negative) appears four times, so {"no", "negative"} is a frequent itemset.
    (eggs, breastfeeding): (true, negative) appears three times, so {"true", "negative"} is a frequent itemset.

Therefore, the set of frequent itemsets with length 2 is:

set_length_2 = {{"6", "cold"},{"6", "no"},{"6", "negative"},{"cold", "no"},{"cold", "negative"},{"no", "negative"},{"true", "negative"}}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 3, so set_length_3= {<<itemsets>>}. Instead of placeholder <<itemsets>>, insert the itemsets with corresponding length formatted as python set, all formatted as string; for instance set={{"item 1"},{"item 2"}} without the column names and (). Consider the first row of the CSV as the name of the columns.

rabbit,6,carnivore,cold,no,true,negative

human,4,herbivore,cold,no,true,negative

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 3, we need to identify the combinations of three items that appear at least twice.

Let's analyze the combinations:

    (legs count, blood, body hair): (6, cold, no) appears three times, so {"6", "cold", "no"} is a frequent itemset.
    (legs count, blood, breastfeeding): (6, cold, negative) appears three times, so {"6", "cold", "negative"} is a frequent itemset.
    (legs count, body hair, breastfeeding): (6, no, negative) appears three times, so {"6", "no", "negative"} is a frequent itemset.
    (blood, body hair, breastfeeding): (cold, no, negative) appears four times, so {"cold", "no", "negative"} is a frequent itemset.

Note that we can also combine the frequent itemsets of length 2 to generate candidates for length 3. For example, combining {"6", "cold"} and {"cold", "no"} gives us {"6", "cold", "no"}.

Therefore, the set of frequent itemsets with length 3 is:

set_length_3 = {{"6", "cold", "no"},{"6", "cold", "negative"},{"6", "no", "negative"},{"cold", "no", "negative"}}

Find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 4, so set_length_4= {<<itemsets>>}. Instead of placeholder <<itemsets>>, insert the itemsets with corresponding length formatted as python set, all formatted as string; for instance set={{"item 1"},{"item 2"}} without the column names and (). Consider the first row of the CSV as the name of the columns.

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 4, we need to identify the combinations of four items that appear at least twice.

Let's analyze the combinations:

    (legs count, blood, body hair, breastfeeding): (6, cold, no, negative) appears three times, so {"6", "cold", "no", "negative"} is a frequent itemset.

Note that we can also combine the frequent itemsets of length 3 to generate candidates for length 4. For example, combining {"6", "cold", "no"} and {"cold", "no", "negative"} gives us {"6", "cold", "no", "negative"}.

There are no other combinations of four items that appear at least twice.

Therefore, the set of frequent itemsets with length 4 is:

set_length_4 = {{"6", "cold", "no", "negative"}}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 5, so set_length_5= {<<itemsets>>}. Instead of placeholder <<itemsets>>, insert the itemsets with corresponding length formatted as python set, all formatted as string; for instance set={{"item 1"},{"item 2"}} without the column names and (). Consider the first row of the CSV as the name of the columns.

LLAMA

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 5, we need to identify the combinations of five items that appear at least twice.

However, upon analyzing the data, we can see that there are no combinations of five items that appear at least twice. The only combination that comes close is (legs count, blood, body hair, breastfeeding, eggs): (6, cold, no, negative, true), but it only appears twice in the rows for fox and rabbit, and the diet is different for these two rows.

Therefore, the set of frequent itemsets with length 5 is:

set_length_5 = {}
