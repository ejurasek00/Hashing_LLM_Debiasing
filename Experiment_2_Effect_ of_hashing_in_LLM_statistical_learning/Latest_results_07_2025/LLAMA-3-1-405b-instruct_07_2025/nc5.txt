Find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 1, so set_length1= {<<itemsets>>}. Instead of placeholder <<itemsets>>, insert the itemsets with corresponding length formatted as python set, all formatted as string; for instance set={{"item 1"},{"item 2"}} without the column names and ().

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 1, we need to identify the individual items (or attributes) that appear at least twice in the dataset. Since the dataset is small, we can do this manually.

Here are the individual items (attributes) and their frequencies:

    name: Each name is unique, so none appear more than once.
    legs count:
        4 appears 3 times
        2 appears 1 time
    diet:
        herbivore appears 1 time
        omnivore appears 2 times
        carnivore appears 1 time
    blood:
        hot appears 4 times
    body hair:
        yes appears 4 times
    eggs:
        false appears 3 times
        true appears 1 time
    breastfeeding:
        indeed appears 4 times

Given the minimal support of 2, the frequent itemsets of length 1 are those attributes or attribute values that appear at least twice. Therefore, the set of frequent itemsets of length 1, formatted as a Python set, would be:

set_length1 = {{"4"},{"omnivore"},{"hot"},{"yes"},{"false"},{"indeed"}}

Find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 2, so set_length2= {<<itemsets>>}. Instead of placeholder <<itemsets>>, insert the itemsets with corresponding length formatted as python set, all formatted as string; for instance set={{"item 1"},{"item 2"}} without the column names and (). Consider the first row of the CSV as the name of the columns.

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 2, we need to identify the combinations of two items (or attributes) that appear at least twice in the dataset. We will consider all possible pairs of attributes and count their occurrences.

Here are the pairs of items and their frequencies:

    (legs count, diet):
        (4, omnivore) appears 2 times
    (legs count, blood):
        (4, hot) appears 3 times
    (legs count, body hair):
        (4, yes) appears 3 times
    (legs count, eggs):
        (4, false) appears 2 times
    (legs count, breastfeeding):
        (4, indeed) appears 3 times
    (diet, blood):
        (omnivore, hot) appears 2 times
    (diet, body hair):
        (omnivore, yes) appears 2 times
    (diet, eggs):
        (omnivore, false) appears 2 times
    (diet, breastfeeding):
        (omnivore, indeed) appears 2 times
    (blood, body hair):
        (hot, yes) appears 4 times
    (blood, eggs):
        (hot, false) appears 3 times
    (blood, breastfeeding):
        (hot, indeed) appears 4 times
    (body hair, eggs):
        (yes, false) appears 3 times
    (body hair, breastfeeding):
        (yes, indeed) appears 4 times
    (eggs, breastfeeding):
        (false, indeed) appears 3 times

Given the minimal support of 2, the frequent itemsets of length 2 are those pairs of attributes or attribute values that appear at least twice. Therefore, the set of frequent itemsets of length 2, formatted as a Python set, would be:

set_length2 = {{"4","omnivore"},{"4","hot"},{"4","yes"},{"4","false"},{"4","indeed"},{"omnivore","hot"},{"omnivore","yes"},{"omnivore","false"},{"omnivore","indeed"},{"hot","yes"},{"hot","false"},{"hot","indeed"},{"yes","false"},{"yes","indeed"},{"false","indeed"}}

Find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 3, so set_length3= {<<itemsets>>}. Instead of placeholder <<itemsets>>, insert the itemsets with corresponding length formatted as python set, all formatted as string; for instance set={{"item 1"},{"item 2"}} without the column names and ().

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 3, we need to identify the combinations of three items (or attributes) that appear at least twice in the dataset. We will consider all possible triplets of attributes and count their occurrences.

Here are the triplets of items and their frequencies:

    (legs count, diet, blood):
        (4, omnivore, hot) appears 2 times
    (legs count, diet, body hair):
        (4, omnivore, yes) appears 2 times
    (legs count, diet, eggs):
        (4, omnivore, false) appears 2 times
    (legs count, diet, breastfeeding):
        (4, omnivore, indeed) appears 2 times
    (legs count, blood, body hair):
        (4, hot, yes) appears 3 times
    (legs count, blood, eggs):
        (4, hot, false) appears 2 times
    (legs count, blood, breastfeeding):

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 4, we need to identify the combinations of four items (or attributes) that appear at least twice in the dataset. We will consider all possible quadruplets of attributes and count their occurrences.

Here are the quadruplets of items and their frequencies:

    (legs count, diet, blood, body hair):
        (4, omnivore, hot, yes) appears 2 times
    (legs count, diet, blood, eggs):

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 5, we need to identify the combinations of five items (or attributes) that appear at least twice in the dataset. We will consider all possible quintuplets of attributes and count their occurrences.

Here are the quintuplets of items and their frequencies:
