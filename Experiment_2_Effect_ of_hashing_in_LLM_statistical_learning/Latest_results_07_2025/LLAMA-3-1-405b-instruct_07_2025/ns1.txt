To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 1, we need to identify the items that appear at least twice in the dataset.

Let's analyze the dataset:

    354,312,624,199,359,331,869
    128,105,943,311,269,032,999

    740,105,251,311,269,420,999

We can see that the following items appear at least twice:

    311 (appears 5 times)
    269 (appears 5 times)
    105 (appears 3 times)
    032 (appears 3 times)
    999 (appears 4 times)

Therefore, the set of frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 1 is:

set_length_1 = {{"311"},{"269"},{"105"},{"032"},{"999"}}

Find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 2, so set_length_2= {<<itemsets>>}.

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 2, we need to identify the pairs of items that appear together at least twice in the dataset.

Let's analyze the dataset:

    740,105,251,311,269,420,999

We can see that the following pairs of items appear together at least twice:

    311, 269 (appear together 5 times)
    311, 032 (appear together 3 times)
    269, 032 (appear together 3 times)

    105, 269 (appear together 3 times)
    311, 999 (appear together 4 times)
    269, 999 (appear together 4 times)

Therefore, the set of frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 2 is:

set_length_2 = {{"311, 269"},{"311, 032"},{"269, 032"},{"105, 311"},{"105, 269"},{"311, 999"},{"269, 999"}}

Find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 3, so set_length_3= {<<itemsets>>}. Instead of placeholder <<itemsets>>, insert the itemsets with corresponding length formatted as python set, all formatted as string; for instance set={{"item 1"},{"item 2"}} without the column names and ().

    740,105,251,311,269,420,999

We can see that the following triplets of items appear together at least twice:

    311, 269, 032 (appear together 3 times)
    105, 311, 269 (appear together 3 times)
    311, 269, 999 (appear together 4 times)

Therefore, the set of frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 3 is:

set_length_3 = {{"311, 269, 032"},{"105, 311, 269"},{"311, 269, 999"}}

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 4, we need to identify the quadruplets of items that appear together at least twice in the dataset.

    740,105,251,311,269,420,999

We can see that the following quadruplets of items appear together at least twice:

    105, 311, 269, 032 (appear together 3 times)

Therefore, the set of frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 4 is:

set_length_4 = {{"105, 311, 269, 032"}}

Find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 5, so set_length_5= {<<itemsets>>}.

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 5, we need to identify the quintuplets of items that appear together at least twice in the dataset.

Let's analyze the dataset:

    354,312,624,199,359,331,869
    128,105,943,311,269,032,999

    740,105,251,311,269,420,999

We can see that there are no quintuplets of items that appear together at least twice.

However, if we look closely, we can see that the following quintuplet appears together twice in rows 3 and 4, and also in a slightly different form in row 2:

    105, 311, 269, 032, 999 does not appear, but 105 is not present in row 2, but 943 is, the rest is the same

However in rows 3 and 4 we have 105,064,311,269,032

And also 105, 311, 269, 032, 999 appears in row 5 but 420 is present instead of 032 or 064

However 105,311,269,032, appears in 3 rows but not with the same 5 elements

Therefore, the set of frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 5 is:

set_length_5 = {}
