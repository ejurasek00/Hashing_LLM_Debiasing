LLAMA

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 1, we need to identify the items that appear at least twice in each column.

Here are the results:

    For the "name" column, no item appears more than once since names are unique.
    For the "legs count" column, the item "4" appears 3 times, which is more than the minimal support.
    For the "diet" column, the items "omnivore" appears 2 times, which meets the minimal support.
    For the "blood" column, the item "hot" appears 4 times, which is more than the minimal support.
    For the "body hair" column, the item "yes" appears 4 times, which is more than the minimal support.
    For the "eggs" column, the item "false" appears 3 times, which is more than the minimal support.
    For the "breastfeeding" column, the item "indeed" appears 4 times, which is more than the minimal support.

Therefore, the set of frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 1 is:

set_length1 = {{"4"},{"omnivore"},{"hot"},{"yes"},{"false"},{"indeed"}}

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 2, we need to identify the combinations of two items that appear at least twice.

Here are the results:

    ("4", "hot") appears 3 times
    ("4", "yes") appears 3 times
    ("4", "indeed") appears 3 times
    ("omnivore", "hot") appears 2 times
    ("omnivore", "yes") appears 2 times
    ("omnivore", "false") appears 2 times
    ("omnivore", "indeed") appears 2 times
    ("hot", "yes") appears 4 times
    ("hot", "indeed") appears 4 times
    ("yes", "indeed") appears 4 times
    ("yes", "false") appears 3 times

Therefore, the set of frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 2 is:

set_length2 = {{"4", "hot"},{"4", "yes"},{"4", "indeed"},{"omnivore", "hot"},{"omnivore", "yes"},{"omnivore", "false"},{"omnivore", "indeed"},{"hot", "yes"},{"hot", "indeed"},{"yes", "indeed"},{"yes", "false"}}

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 3, we need to identify the combinations of three items that appear at least twice.

Here are the results:

    ("4", "hot", "yes") appears 3 times
    ("4", "hot", "indeed") appears 3 times
    ("4", "yes", "indeed") appears 3 times
    ("omnivore", "hot", "yes") appears 2 times

    ("omnivore", "yes", "false") appears 2 times
    ("hot", "yes", "indeed") appears 4 times
    ("hot", "yes", "false") appears 3 times

Therefore, the set of frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 3 is:

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 5, we need to identify the combinations of five items that appear at least twice.

Here are the results:

    ("4", "hot", "yes", "indeed", "false") does not appear, because "4" and "false" only appear together twice with the other three, but "4" is not present in the human row, which has the other four
    ("omnivore", "hot", "yes", "indeed", "false") appears 2 times

Therefore, the set of frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 5 is:

set_length5 = {{"omnivore", "hot", "yes", "indeed", "false"}}
