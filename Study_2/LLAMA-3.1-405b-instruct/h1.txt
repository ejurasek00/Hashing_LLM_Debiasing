LLAMA

To find all frequent itemsets with a minimal support equal to 2 and length 1, we need to identify items that appear at least twice across all transactions.

Let's analyze each column:

    Column 1: 354C31 (1), B2895C (1), 1520D1 (1), 0BEA8D (1), 7EA60D (1) -> No item appears more than once.
    Column 2: DBCEEF (1), B0FAAD (3), 49E95E (1), B0FAAD (1), B0FAAD (1) -> B0FAAD appears 3 times.
    Column 3: 6CE255 (1), 9ED0E8 (1), A6463C (2), A6463C (1), C5B9CC (1) -> A6463C appears 2 times.
    Column 4: 199D26 (1), D11884 (4), D11884 (1), D11884 (1), D11884 (1) -> D11884 appears 4 times.
    Column 5: D59553 (1), 269963 (4), 269963 (1), 269963 (1), 269963 (1) -> 269963 appears 4 times.
    Column 6: 331981 (1), ADC8A2 (3), ADC8A2 (1), ADC8A2 (1), 420666 (1) -> ADC8A2 appears 3 times.
    Column 7: 869F50 (1), 999999 (4), 999999 (1), 999999 (1), 999999 (1) -> 999999 appears 4 times.

Therefore, the frequent itemsets with a minimal support equal to 2 and length 1 are:

set_length_1 = {{"B0FAAD"},{"A6463C"},{"D11884"},{"269963"},{"ADC8A2"},{"999999"}}

To find all frequent itemsets with a minimal support equal to 2 and length 2, we need to identify pairs of items that appear together at least twice across all transactions.

Let's analyze each pair of columns:

    Columns 1-2: No pair appears more than once.
    Columns 1-3: No pair appears more than once.
    Columns 1-4: No pair appears more than once.
    Columns 1-5: No pair appears more than once.
    Columns 1-6: No pair appears more than once.
    Columns 1-7: No pair appears more than once.
    Columns 2-3: (B0FAAD, A6463C) appears 2 times.
    Columns 2-4: (B0FAAD, D11884) appears 3 times.
    Columns 2-5: (B0FAAD, 269963) appears 3 times.
    Columns 2-6: (B0FAAD, ADC8A2) appears 2 times.
    Columns 2-7: (B0FAAD, 999999) appears 3 times.
    Columns 3-4: (A6463C, D11884) appears 2 times.
    Columns 3-5: (A6463C, 269963) appears 2 times.
    Columns 3-6: (A6463C, ADC8A2) appears 2 times.
    Columns 3-7: (A6463C, 999999) appears 2 times.
    Columns 4-5: (D11884, 269963) appears 4 times.
    Columns 4-6: (D11884, ADC8A2) appears 3 times.
    Columns 4-7: (D11884, 999999) appears 4 times.
    Columns 5-6: (269963, ADC8A2) appears 3 times.
    Columns 5-7: (269963, 999999) appears 4 times.
    Columns 6-7: (ADC8A2, 999999) appears 3 times.

Therefore, the frequent itemsets with a minimal support equal to 2 and length 2 are:

set_length_2 = {{"B0FAAD", "A6463C"},{"B0FAAD", "D11884"},{"B0FAAD", "269963"},{"B0FAAD", "ADC8A2"},{"B0FAAD", "999999"},{"A6463C", "D11884"},{"A6463C", "269963"},{"A6463C", "ADC8A2"},{"A6463C", "999999"},{"D11884", "269963"},{"D11884", "ADC8A2"},{"D11884", "999999"},{"269963", "ADC8A2"},{"269963", "999999"},{"ADC8A2", "999999"}}
