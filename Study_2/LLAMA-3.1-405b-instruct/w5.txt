Find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 1, so set_length_1= {<<itemsets>>}. Instead of placeholder <<itemsets>>, insert the itemsets with corresponding length formatted as python set, all formatted as string; for instance set={{"item 1"},{"item 2"}} without the column names and (). Consider the first row of the CSV as the name of the columns.

rabbit,6,carnivore,cold,no,true,negative

human,4,herbivore,cold,no,true,negative

LLAMA

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 1, we need to identify the items that appear at least twice in each column.

Here are the results:

    name: Not applicable, as names are unique.
    legs count: {{"6"}}
    diet: {{"herbivore"}, {"carnivore"}}
    blood: {{"cold"}}
    body hair: {{"no"}}
    eggs: {{"true"}}
    breastfeeding: {{"negative"}}

So, the set_length_1 is:

set_length_1 = {{"6"},{"herbivore"},{"carnivore"},{"cold"},{"no"},{"true"},{"negative"}}

LLAMA

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 2, we need to identify the combinations of two items that appear at least twice.

Here are the results:

    (legs count, diet): {{"6", "herbivore"}}
    (legs count, blood): {{"6", "cold"}}
    (legs count, body hair): {{"6", "no"}}
    (legs count, breastfeeding): {{"6", "negative"}}
    (diet, blood): {{"herbivore", "cold"}}
    (diet, body hair): {{"herbivore", "no"}}
    (diet, eggs): {{"herbivore", "true"}}
    (diet, breastfeeding): {{"herbivore", "negative"}}
    (blood, body hair): {{"cold", "no"}}
    (blood, eggs): {{"cold", "true"}}
    (blood, breastfeeding): {{"cold", "negative"}}
    (body hair, eggs): {{"no", "true"}}
    (body hair, breastfeeding): {{"no", "negative"}}
    (eggs, breastfeeding): {{"true", "negative"}}

So, the set_length_2 is:

set_length_2 = {{"6", "herbivore"},{"6", "cold"},{"6", "no"},{"6", "negative"},{"herbivore", "cold"},{"herbivore", "no"},{"herbivore", "true"},{"herbivore", "negative"},{"cold", "no"},{"cold", "true"},{"cold", "negative"},{"no", "true"},{"no", "negative"},{"true", "negative"}}

Find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 3, so set_length_3= {<<itemsets>>}. Instead of placeholder <<itemsets>>, insert the itemsets with corresponding length formatted as python set, all formatted as string; for instance set={{"item 1"},{"item 2"}} without the column names and (). Consider the first row of the CSV as the name of the columns.

name,legs count,diet,blood,body hair,eggs,breastfeeding

rabbit,6,carnivore,cold,no,true,negative

LLAMA

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 3, we need to identify the combinations of three items that appear at least twice.

Here are the results:

    (legs count, diet, blood): {{"6", "herbivore", "cold"}}
    (legs count, diet, body hair): {{"6", "herbivore", "no"}}
    (legs count, diet, eggs): {{"6", "herbivore", "true"}}
    (legs count, diet, breastfeeding): {{"6", "herbivore", "negative"}}
    (legs count, blood, body hair): {{"6", "cold", "no"}}
    (legs count, blood, breastfeeding): {{"6", "cold", "negative"}}
    (diet, blood, body hair): {{"herbivore", "cold", "no"}}
    (diet, blood, eggs): {{"herbivore", "cold", "true"}}
    (diet, blood, breastfeeding): {{"herbivore", "cold", "negative"}}
    (blood, body hair, eggs): {{"cold", "no", "true"}}
    (blood, body hair, breastfeeding): {{"cold", "no", "negative"}}
    (blood, eggs, breastfeeding): {{"cold", "true", "negative"}}
    (body hair, eggs, breastfeeding): {{"no", "true", "negative"}}

However, not all of these combinations meet the minimal support requirement of 2. After re-examining the data, we can see that the following combinations appear at least twice:

    {{"6", "cold", "no"}}
    {{"6", "cold", "negative"}}
    {{"herbivore", "cold", "no"}}
    {{"herbivore", "cold", "true"}}
    {{"herbivore", "cold", "negative"}}
    {{"cold", "no", "true"}}
    {{"cold", "no", "negative"}}
    {{"cold", "true", "negative"}}
    {{"no", "true", "negative"}}

So, the set_length_3 is:

set_length_3 = {{"6", "cold", "no"},{"6", "cold", "negative"},{"herbivore", "cold", "no"},{"herbivore", "cold", "true"},{"herbivore", "cold", "negative"},{"cold", "no", "true"},{"cold", "no", "negative"},{"cold", "true", "negative"},{"no", "true", "negative"}}

Find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 4, so set_length_4= {<<itemsets>>}. Instead of placeholder <<itemsets>>, insert the itemsets with corresponding length formatted as python set, all formatted as string; for instance set={{"item 1"},{"item 2"}} without the column names and (). Consider the first row of the CSV as the name of the columns.

    (legs count, diet, blood, eggs): {{"6", "herbivore", "cold", "true"}}
    (legs count, diet, blood, breastfeeding): {{"6", "herbivore", "cold", "negative"}}

    (diet, blood, body hair, eggs): {{"herbivore", "cold", "no", "true"}}
    (diet, blood, body hair, breastfeeding): {{"herbivore", "cold", "no", "negative"}}

    {{"herbivore", "cold", "no", "true"}}
    {{"herbivore", "cold", "no", "negative"}}
    {{"cold", "no", "true", "negative"}}

So, the set_length_4 is:

set_length_4 = {{"6", "cold", "no", "true"},{"6", "cold", "no", "negative"},{"herbivore", "cold", "no", "true"},{"herbivore", "cold", "no", "negative"},{"cold", "no", "true", "negative"}}

Find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 5, so set_length_5= {<<itemsets>>}.
