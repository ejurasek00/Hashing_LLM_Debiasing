LLAMA

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 1, we need to identify the items that appear at least twice in each column.

Here are the results:

    For the "name" column, no item appears more than once since names are unique, so it's not considered.
    For the "legs count" column, the item "4" appears 3 times, and "2" appears only once. So, the frequent itemset here is {"4"}.
    For the "diet" column, "omnivore" appears twice, "herbivore" and "carnivore" each appear once. So, the frequent itemset here is {"omnivore"}.
    For the "blood" column, "hot" appears 4 times, making it a frequent itemset as {"hot"}.
    For the "body hair" column, "yes" appears 4 times, making it a frequent itemset as {"yes"}.
    For the "eggs" column, "false" appears 3 times, and "true" appears once. So, the frequent itemset here is {"false"}.
    For the "breastfeeding" column, "indeed" appears 4 times, making it a frequent itemset as {"indeed"}.

Therefore, the set of all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 1 is:

set_length1 = {{"4"},{"omnivore"},{"hot"},{"yes"},{"false"},{"indeed"}}

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 2, we need to identify the combinations of two items that appear at least twice together.

Here are the results:

    ("4", "hot") appears 3 times
    ("4", "yes") appears 3 times
    ("4", "indeed") appears 3 times
    ("omnivore", "hot") appears 2 times
    ("omnivore", "yes") appears 2 times
    ("omnivore", "false") appears 2 times
    ("omnivore", "indeed") appears 2 times
    ("hot", "yes") appears 4 times
    ("hot", "indeed") appears 4 times
    ("yes", "indeed") appears 4 times
    ("yes", "false") appears 3 times
    ("false", "indeed") appears 3 times

Therefore, the set of all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 2 is:

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 3, we need to identify the combinations of three items that appear at least twice together.

Here are the results:

    ("4", "hot", "yes") appears 3 times
    ("4", "hot", "indeed") appears 3 times
    ("4", "yes", "indeed") appears 3 times
    ("omnivore", "hot", "yes") appears 2 times

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 5, we need to identify the combinations of five items that appear at least twice together.

Here are the results:

    ("omnivore", "hot", "yes", "false", "indeed") appears 2 times
    ("hot", "yes", "false", "4", "indeed") does not appear, however ("4", "hot", "yes", "false", "indeed") appears only once for "4" with other 4 items and ("4", "hot", "yes", "indeed") appears 3 times for "4" with other 4 items that is ("4", "hot", "yes", "indeed") and other is ("4", "hot", "yes", "false") that appears only once, but ("hot", "yes", "false", "indeed") appears 3 times, that is why ("4" is not with them)
    No other combination of 5 items appears at least twice.

Therefore, the set of all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 5 is:

set_length5 = {{"omnivore", "hot", "yes", "false", "indeed"}}
