Find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 1, so set_length_1= {<<itemsets>>}. Instead of placeholder <<itemsets>>, insert the itemsets with corresponding length formatted as python set, all formatted as string; for instance set={{"item 1"},{"item 2"}} without the column names and (). Consider the first row of the CSV as the name of the columns.

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 1, we need to identify the individual items (attributes) that appear at least twice in the dataset. Let's analyze each column:

    name: Each name is unique, so there are no frequent itemsets here.
    legs count:
        6 appears 3 times, so it is frequent.
        4 appears only once, so it is not frequent.
    diet:
        carnivore appears only once, so it is not frequent.
        herbivore appears twice, so it is frequent.
        omnivore appears only once, so it is not frequent.
    blood:
        cold appears 4 times, so it is frequent.
    body hair:
        no appears 4 times, so it is frequent.
    eggs:
        true appears 3 times, so it is frequent.
        false appears only once, so it is not frequent.
    breastfeeding:
        negative appears 4 times, so it is frequent.

Therefore, the set of frequent itemsets with length 1 and minimal support equal to 2 is:

set_length_1 = {{"6"},{"herbivore"},{"cold"},{"no"},{"true"},{"negative"}}

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 2, we need to identify the pairs of items (attributes) that appear at least twice in the dataset. Let's analyze each pair:

    legs count and diet:
        (6, herbivore) appears twice, so it is frequent.
        Other pairs appear only once or not at all.
    legs count and blood:
        (6, cold) appears 3 times, so it is frequent.
    legs count and body hair:
        (6, no) appears 3 times, so it is frequent.
    legs count and eggs:
        (6, true) appears twice, so it is frequent.
    legs count and breastfeeding:
        (6, negative) appears 3 times, so it is frequent.
    diet and blood:
        (herbivore, cold) appears twice, so it is frequent.
    diet and body hair:
        (herbivore, no) appears twice, so it is frequent.
    diet and eggs:
        (herbivore, true) appears twice, so it is frequent.
    diet and breastfeeding:
        (herbivore, negative) appears twice, so it is frequent.
    blood and body hair:
        (cold, no) appears 4 times, so it is frequent.
    blood and eggs:
        (cold, true) appears 3 times, so it is frequent.
    blood and breastfeeding:
        (cold, negative) appears 4 times, so it is frequent.
    body hair and eggs:
        (no, true) appears 3 times, so it is frequent.

    legs count, diet, body hair, eggs, and breastfeeding:
        (6, herbivore, no, true, negative) appears twice, so it is frequent.
    legs count, blood, body hair, eggs, and breastfeeding:
