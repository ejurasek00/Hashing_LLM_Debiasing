Based on the provided dataset and the task requirements, we need to find
all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 1. The
dataset contains information about animals with different attributes.

Let's analyze the dataset and extract the frequent itemsets:

  * We have four attributes that can be considered for itemsets: |legs
    count|, |diet|, |blood|, and |eggs|.
  * Each attribute has a limited number of possible values based on the
    dataset.

Let's go through each attribute and determine the frequent itemsets with
support equal to or greater than 2.


      Attribute: legs count

  * Possible values: 2, 4

*Frequent itemsets:*

  * {"2"} (Support: 1)
  * {"4"} (Support: 3)


      Attribute: diet

  * Possible values: herbivore, omnivore, carnivore

*Frequent itemsets:*

  * {"herbivore"} (Support: 1)
  * {"omnivore"} (Support: 2)
  * {"carnivore"} (Support: 1)


      Attribute: blood

  * Possible values: hot

*Frequent itemsets:*

  * {"hot"} (Support: 4)


      Attribute: eggs

  * Possible values: false, true

*Frequent itemsets:*

  * {"false"} (Support: 3)
  * {"true"} (Support: 1)


      Conclusion

Combining all the frequent itemsets from each attribute, we have the
following frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 1:


|{"2"}
{"4"}
{"herbivore"}
{"omnivore"}
{"carnivore"}
{"hot"}
{"false"}
|

These are the itemsets formatted as requested. Each set represents a
frequent itemset with length 1 and support of at least 2 based on the
given dataset.

Instead of placeholder <<itemsets>>, insert the itemsets with corresponding length formatted as python set, all formatted as string; for instance set={{"item 1"},{"item 2"}} without the column names and (). Consider the first row of the CSV as the name of the columns.

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length
2, we need to examine combinations of pairs of attributes from the
dataset. We'll then count how many times each pair appears together
across the rows and identify those pairs that have a support of at least 2.

Here is the dataset again for reference:



|name,legs count,diet,blood,body hair,eggs,breastfeeding
rabbit,4,herbivore,hot,yes,false,indeed
human,2,omnivore,hot,yes,false,indeed
fox,4,omnivore,hot,yes,false,indeed
platypus,4,carnivore,hot,yes,true,indeed
|


      Step-by-Step Process

 1. *List Possible Pairs:* Generate all possible pairs of attributes'
    values.
 2. *Count Support:* Count the number of rows in which each pair occurs.
 3. *Filter by Support:* Identify pairs with support of at least 2.


        Combinations of Attributes' Values:

  * |legs count| pairs: {{"2"}, {"4"}}
  * |diet| pairs: {{"herbivore"}, {"omnivore"}, {"carnivore"}}
  * |blood| pairs: {{"hot"}}
  * |body hair| pairs: {{"yes"}}
  * |eggs| pairs: {{"false"}, {"true"}}
  * |breastfeeding| pairs: {{"indeed"}}


        Combinations and Counting Support

Let's combine and count pairs of attributes' values:

 1. *(4, hot):* Appears in rows 1, 3, 4 (Support: 3)
 2. *(4, yes):* Appears in rows 1, 3, 4 (Support: 3)
 3. *(4, indeed):* Appears in rows 1, 3, 4 (Support: 3)
 4. *(omnivore, hot):* Appears in rows 2, 3 (Support: 2)
 5. *(omnivore, yes):* Appears in rows 2, 3 (Support: 2)
 6. *(omnivore, indeed):* Appears in rows 2, 3 (Support: 2)
 7. *(hot, yes):* Appears in rows 1, 2, 3, 4 (Support: 4)
 8. *(hot, indeed):* Appears in rows 1, 2, 3, 4 (Support: 4)
 9. *(yes, indeed):* Appears in rows 1, 2, 3, 4 (Support: 4)
10. *(false, indeed):* Appears in rows 1, 2, 3 (Support: 3)
11. *(hot, false):* Appears in rows 1, 2, 3 (Support: 3)
12. *(yes, false):* Appears in rows 1, 2, 3 (Support: 3)


      Frequent Itemsets with Minimal Support Equal to 2 and Length 2:

The pairs with a support of at least 2 are:



|{{"4", "hot"}, {"4", "yes"}, {"4", "indeed"}, {"omnivore", "hot"}, {"omnivore", "yes"}, {"omnivore", "indeed"}, {"hot", "yes"}, {"hot", "indeed"}, {"yes", "indeed"}, {"false", "indeed"}, {"hot", "false"}, {"yes", "false"}}
|

These itemsets represent combinations of attributes' values that appear
together in at least two rows of the dataset.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------         

Find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 3, so set_length3= {<<itemsets>>}. Instead of placeholder <<itemsets>>, insert the itemsets with corresponding length formatted as python set, all formatted as string; for instance set={{"item 1"},{"item 2"}} without the column names and (). Consider the first row of the CSV as the name of the columns.

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length
3, we need to consider all possible combinations of three attributes'
values and count how many times each combination appears together in the
dataset.

Here is the dataset again for reference:



|name,legs count,diet,blood,body hair,eggs,breastfeeding
rabbit,4,herbivore,hot,yes,false,indeed
human,2,omnivore,hot,yes,false,indeed
fox,4,omnivore,hot,yes,false,indeed
platypus,4,carnivore,hot,yes,true,indeed
|


      Step-by-Step Process

 1. *List Possible Triples:* Generate all possible combinations of three
    attributes' values.
 2. *Count Support:* Count the number of rows in which each combination
    occurs.
 3. *Filter by Support:* Identify combinations with support of at least 2.


        Combinations of Attributes' Values:

Let's identify the frequent pairs with support of at least 2 and build
upon those.

From the previous step (length 2 frequent itemsets), we have:



|{{"4", "hot"}, {"4", "yes"}, {"4", "indeed"}, {"omnivore", "hot"}, {"omnivore", "yes"}, {"omnivore", "indeed"}, {"hot", "yes"}, {"hot", "indeed"}, {"yes", "indeed"}, {"false", "indeed"}, {"hot", "false"}, {"yes", "false"}}|

Let's combine these to form triples and count their support.


      Frequent Triples (Length 3 Itemsets):

 1. *(4, hot, yes):* Appears in rows 1, 3, 4 (Support: 3)
 2. *(4, hot, indeed):* Appears in rows 1, 3, 4 (Support: 3)
 3. *(4, yes, indeed):* Appears in rows 1, 3, 4 (Support: 3)
 4. *(omnivore, hot, yes):* Appears in rows 2, 3 (Support: 2)
 5. *(omnivore, hot, indeed):* Appears in rows 2, 3 (Support: 2)
 6. *(omnivore, yes, indeed):* Appears in rows 2, 3 (Support: 2)
 7. *(hot, yes, indeed):* Appears in rows 1, 2, 3, 4 (Support: 4)
 8. *(hot, yes, false):* Appears in rows 1, 2, 3 (Support: 3)
 9. *(hot, false, indeed):* Appears in rows 1, 2, 3 (Support: 3)
10. *(yes, false, indeed):* Appears in rows 1, 2, 3 (Support: 3)


      Frequent Itemsets with Minimal Support Equal to 2 and Length 3:

The triples with a support of at least 2 are:



|{{"4", "hot", "yes"}, {"4", "hot", "indeed"}, {"4", "yes", "indeed"}, {"omnivore", "hot", "yes"}, {"omnivore", "hot", "indeed"}, {"omnivore", "yes", "indeed"}, {"hot", "yes", "indeed"}, {"hot", "yes", "false"}, {"hot", "false", "indeed"}, {"yes", "false", "indeed"}}
|

These itemsets represent combinations of attributes' values that appear
together in at least two rows of the dataset.
