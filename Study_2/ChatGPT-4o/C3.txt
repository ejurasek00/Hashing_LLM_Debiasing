To solve this problem, let's identify the frequent itemsets with a
minimum support of 2 and length 1.

*Step 1:* Break down the dataset into individual items.

  * *name*: rabbit, human, fox, platypus
  * *legs count*: 4, 2, 4, 4
  * *diet*: herbivore, omnivore, omnivore, carnivore
  * *blood*: hot, hot, hot, hot
  * *body hair*: yes, yes, yes, yes
  * *eggs*: false, false, false, true
  * *breastfeeding*: indeed, indeed, indeed, indeed

*Step 2:* Count the frequency of each unique item.

  * *name*:
      o rabbit: 1
      o human: 1
      o fox: 1
      o platypus: 1
  * *legs count*:
      o 4: 3
      o 2: 1
  * *diet*:
      o herbivore: 1
      o omnivore: 2
      o carnivore: 1
  * *blood*:
      o hot: 4
  * *body hair*:
      o yes: 4
  * *eggs*:
      o false: 3
      o true: 1
  * *breastfeeding*:
      o indeed: 4

*Step 3:* Select itemsets with a frequency of at least 2.

  * *legs count*:
      o 4: 3
  * *diet*:
      o omnivore: 2
  * *blood*:
      o hot: 4
  * *body hair*:
      o yes: 4
  * *eggs*:
      o false: 3
  * *breastfeeding*:
      o indeed: 4

*Step 4:* Format the results as Python sets.

To find all frequent itemsets of length 2 with a minimum support of 2,
we need to look at all possible pairs of items in the dataset and
determine their frequency.


      Step 1: Identify all possible pairs of items.

We will consider combinations of items from the following categories:

  * *name*: rabbit, human, fox, platypus
  * *legs count*: 4, 2
  * *diet*: herbivore, omnivore, carnivore
  * *blood*: hot
  * *body hair*: yes
  * *eggs*: false, true
  * *breastfeeding*: indeed


      Step 2: List the pairs and count their frequency.

Here are the relevant pairs from the dataset:

 1.

    *(legs count = 4, diet = omnivore)*: fox and platypus each have legs
    count 4, omnivore applies to human and fox.

      * Fox has both: (4, omnivore) → appears once.
 2.

    *(legs count = 4, blood = hot)*: All three animals with 4 legs
    (rabbit, fox, platypus) have hot blood.

      * Appears three times.
 3.

    *(legs count = 4, body hair = yes)*: All three animals with 4 legs
    have body hair.

      * Appears three times.
 4.

    *(legs count = 4, eggs = false)*: Only fox and rabbit have 4 legs
    and don’t lay eggs.

      * Appears twice.
 5.

    *(legs count = 4, breastfeeding = indeed)*: All three animals with 4
    legs have breastfeeding.

      * Appears three times.
 6.

    *(legs count = 2, blood = hot)*: Human with 2 legs has hot blood.

      * Appears once.
 7.

    *(diet = omnivore, blood = hot)*: Human and fox have omnivore diets
    and hot blood.

      * Appears twice.
 8.

    *(diet = omnivore, body hair = yes)*: Human and fox have omnivore
    diets and body hair.

      * Appears twice.
 9.

    *(diet = omnivore, eggs = false)*: Human and fox have omnivore diets
    and don’t lay eggs.

      * Appears twice.
10.

    *(diet = omnivore, breastfeeding = indeed)*: Human and fox have
    omnivore diets and breastfeeding.

      * Appears twice.
11.

    *(blood = hot, body hair = yes)*: All animals with hot blood have
    body hair.

      * Appears four times.
12.

    *(blood = hot, eggs = false)*: Rabbit, human, fox have hot blood and
    don’t lay eggs.

      * Appears three times.
13.

    *(blood = hot, breastfeeding = indeed)*: All animals with hot blood
    breastfeed.

      * Appears four times.
14.

    *(body hair = yes, eggs = false)*: Rabbit, human, fox have body hair
    and don’t lay eggs.

      * Appears three times.
15.

    *(body hair = yes, breastfeeding = indeed)*: All animals with body
    hair breastfeed.

      * Appears four times.
16.

    *(eggs = false, breastfeeding = indeed)*: Rabbit, human, fox don’t
    lay eggs but do breastfeed.

      * Appears three times.


      Step 3: Select pairs with a minimum support of 2.

The pairs that appear at least twice are:

  * (legs count = 4, blood = hot)
  * (legs count = 4, body hair = yes)
  * (legs count = 4, breastfeeding = indeed)
  * (legs count = 4, eggs = false)
  * (diet = omnivore, blood = hot)
  * (diet = omnivore, body hair = yes)
  * (diet = omnivore, eggs = false)
  * (diet = omnivore, breastfeeding = indeed)
  * (blood = hot, body hair = yes)
  * (blood = hot, eggs = false)
  * (blood = hot, breastfeeding = indeed)
  * (body hair = yes, eggs = false)
  * (body hair = yes, breastfeeding = indeed)
  * (eggs = false, breastfeeding = indeed)


      Step 4: Format the results as Python sets.



|set_length2 = {{"4", "hot"},{"4", "yes"},{"4", "indeed"},{"4", "false"},{"omnivore", "hot"},{"omnivore", "yes"},{"omnivore", "false"},{"omnivore", "indeed"},{"hot", "yes"},{"hot", "false"},{"hot", "indeed"},{"yes", "false"},{"yes", "indeed"},{"false", "indeed"}}
