LLAMA

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 1, we need to identify the items that appear at least twice in each column.

Let's analyze each column:

    name: Each name is unique, so there are no frequent itemsets in this column.
    legs count: We have 6 (3 times) and 4 (1 time). The frequent itemset is {{"6"}}.
    diet: We have carnivore (1 time), herbivore (2 times), and omnivore (1 time). The frequent itemset is {{"herbivore"}}.
    blood: We have cold (4 times). The frequent itemset is {{"cold"}}.
    body hair: We have no (4 times). The frequent itemset is {{"no"}}.
    eggs: We have true (3 times) and false (1 time). The frequent itemset is {{"true"}}.
    breastfeeding: We have negative (4 times). The frequent itemset is {{"negative"}}.

Combining all the frequent itemsets with length 1, we get:

set_length_1 = {{"6"},{"herbivore"},{"cold"},{"no"},{"true"},{"negative"}}

LLAMA

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 2, we need to identify the combinations of two items that appear at least twice.

Let's analyze the combinations:

    legs count and diet: We have (6, carnivore) (1 time), (4, herbivore) (1 time), (6, herbivore) (2 times), and (6, omnivore) (1 time). The frequent itemset is {{"6", "herbivore"}}.
    legs count and blood: We have (6, cold) (3 times) and (4, cold) (1 time). The frequent itemset is {{"6", "cold"}}.
    legs count and body hair: We have (6, no) (3 times) and (4, no) (1 time). The frequent itemset is {{"6", "no"}}.
    legs count and eggs: We have (6, true) (2 times), (6, false) (1 time), and (4, true) (1 time). The frequent itemset is {{"6", "true"}}.
    legs count and breastfeeding: We have (6, negative) (3 times) and (4, negative) (1 time). The frequent itemset is {{"6", "negative"}}.
    diet and blood: We have (carnivore, cold) (1 time), (herbivore, cold) (2 times), and (omnivore, cold) (1 time). The frequent itemset is {{"herbivore", "cold"}}.
    diet and body hair: We have (carnivore, no) (1 time), (herbivore, no) (2 times), and (omnivore, no) (1 time). The frequent itemset is {{"herbivore", "no"}}.
    diet and eggs: We have (carnivore, true) (1 time), (herbivore, true) (2 times), and (omnivore, false) (1 time). The frequent itemset is {{"herbivore", "true"}}.
    diet and breastfeeding: We have (carnivore, negative) (1 time), (herbivore, negative) (2 times), and (omnivore, negative) (1 time). The frequent itemset is {{"herbivore", "negative"}}.
    blood and body hair: We have (cold, no) (4 times). The frequent itemset is {{"cold", "no"}}.
    blood and eggs: We have (cold, true) (3 times) and (cold, false) (1 time). The frequent itemset is {{"cold", "true"}}.
    blood and breastfeeding: We have (cold, negative) (4 times). The frequent itemset is {{"cold", "negative"}}.
    body hair and eggs: We have (no, true) (3 times) and (no, false) (1 time). The frequent itemset is {{"no", "true"}}.
    body hair and breastfeeding: We have (no, negative) (4 times). The frequent itemset is {{"no", "negative"}}.
    eggs and breastfeeding: We have (true, negative) (3 times) and (false, negative) (1 time). The frequent itemset is {{"true", "negative"}}.

Combining all the frequent itemsets with length 2, we get:

set_length_2 = {{"6", "herbivore"},{"6", "cold"},{"6", "no"},{"6", "true"},{"6", "negative"},{"herbivore", "cold"},{"herbivore", "no"},{"herbivore", "true"},{"herbivore", "negative"},{"cold", "no"},{"cold", "true"},{"cold", "negative"},{"no", "true"},{"no", "negative"},{"true", "negative"}}
