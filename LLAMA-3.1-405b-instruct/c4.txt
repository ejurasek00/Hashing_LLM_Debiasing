To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 1, we need to identify the individual items (or attributes) that appear at least twice in the dataset. Since we're not considering combinations of items (as length is 1), we'll look at each attribute's values and identify any value that appears at least twice.

Given the dataset:

    legs count: 4 appears 3 times, 2 appears 1 time.
        Frequent item: {"4"}

    diet: herbivore appears 1 time, omnivore appears 2 times, carnivore appears 1 time.
        Frequent item: {"omnivore"}

    blood: hot appears 4 times.
        Frequent item: {"hot"}

    body hair: yes appears 4 times.
        Frequent item: {"yes"}

    eggs: false appears 3 times, true appears 1 time.
        Frequent item: {"false"}

    breastfeeding: indeed appears 4 times.
        Frequent item: {"indeed"}

Therefore, the set of frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 1 is:

set_length1 = {{"4"},{"omnivore"},{"hot"},{"yes"},{"false"},{"indeed"}}

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 2, we need to identify the combinations of two items (or attributes) that appear at least twice in the dataset.

        Frequent item: {"4", "omnivore"}

    legs count & blood:

    legs count & eggs:
