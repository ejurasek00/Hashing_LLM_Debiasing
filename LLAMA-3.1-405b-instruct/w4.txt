LLAMA

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 1, we need to identify the individual items (or attributes) that appear at least twice in the dataset. Since we're considering itemsets of length 1, each unique attribute value that meets the support criteria will be included.

Let's analyze each column:

    name: Each name is unique, so there are no itemsets of length 1 with support of 2 or more.
    legs count:
        6 appears 3 times, so it meets the criteria.
        4 appears only once, so it does not meet the criteria.
    diet:
        carnivore appears only once, so it does not meet the criteria.
        herbivore appears twice, so it meets the criteria.
        omnivore appears only once, so it does not meet the criteria.
    blood:
        cold appears 4 times, so it meets the criteria.
    body hair:
        no appears 4 times, so it meets the criteria.
    eggs:
        true appears 3 times, so it meets the criteria.
        false appears only once, so it does not meet the criteria.
    breastfeeding:
        negative appears 4 times, so it meets the criteria.

Therefore, the set of frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 1 is:

set_length_1 = {{"6"},{"herbivore"},{"cold"},{"no"},{"true"},{"negative"}}

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 2, we need to identify the combinations of two items (or attributes) that appear at least twice in the dataset.

Let's analyze the combinations:

    legs count & diet:
        (6, herbivore) appears twice, so it meets the criteria.
    legs count & blood:
        (6, cold) appears 3 times, so it meets the criteria.
    legs count & body hair:
        (6, no) appears 3 times, so it meets the criteria.
    legs count & eggs:
        (6, true) appears twice, so it meets the criteria.
    legs count & breastfeeding:
        (6, negative) appears 3 times, so it meets the criteria.
    diet & blood:
        (herbivore, cold) appears twice, so it meets the criteria.
    diet & body hair:
        (herbivore, no) appears twice, so it meets the criteria.
    diet & eggs:
        (herbivore, true) appears twice, so it meets the criteria.
    diet & breastfeeding:
        (herbivore, negative) appears twice, so it meets the criteria.
    blood & body hair:
        (cold, no) appears 4 times, so it meets the criteria.
    blood & eggs:
        (cold, true) appears 3 times, so it meets the criteria.
    blood & breastfeeding:
        (cold, negative) appears 4 times, so it meets the criteria.
    body hair & eggs:
        (no, true) appears 3 times, so it meets the criteria.
    body hair & breastfeeding:
        (no, negative) appears 4 times, so it meets the criteria.
    eggs & breastfeeding:
        (true, negative) appears 3 times, so it meets the criteria.

Therefore, the set of frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 2 is:
