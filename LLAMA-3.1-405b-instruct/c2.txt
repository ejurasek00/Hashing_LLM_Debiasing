To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 1, we need to identify the individual items (or attributes) that appear at least twice in the dataset. Since the length is 1, we are looking at each attribute individually.

Given the dataset:

    name: rabbit, human, fox, platypus
    legs count: 4, 2, 4, 4
    diet: herbivore, omnivore, omnivore, carnivore
    blood: hot, hot, hot, hot
    body hair: yes, yes, yes, yes
    eggs: false, false, false, true
    breastfeeding: indeed, indeed, indeed, indeed

Let's identify the frequent itemsets with a support of at least 2:

    For "legs count": {4} appears 3 times, {2} appears 1 time. So, {4} is a frequent itemset.
    For "diet": {herbivore} appears 1 time, {omnivore} appears 2 times, {carnivore} appears 1 time. So, {omnivore} is a frequent itemset.
    For "blood": {hot} appears 4 times. So, {hot} is a frequent itemset.
    For "body hair": {yes} appears 4 times. So, {yes} is a frequent itemset.
    For "eggs": {false} appears 3 times, {true} appears 1 time. So, {false} is a frequent itemset.
    For "breastfeeding": {indeed} appears 4 times. So, {indeed} is a frequent itemset.

Therefore, the set of frequent itemsets with length 1 and minimal support equal to 2 is:

set_length1 = {{"4"},{"omnivore"},{"hot"},{"yes"},{"false"},{"indeed"}}

Find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 2, so set_length2= {<<itemsets>>}. Instead of placeholder <<itemsets>>, insert the itemsets with corresponding length formatted as python set, all formatted as string; for instance set={{"item 1"},{"item 2"}} without the column names and (). Consider the first row of the CSV as the name of the columns.

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 2, we need to identify the combinations of two items (or attributes) that appear at least twice in the dataset.

Given the dataset:

    name: rabbit, human, fox, platypus
    legs count: 4, 2, 4, 4
    diet: herbivore, omnivore, omnivore, carnivore
    blood: hot, hot, hot, hot
    body hair: yes, yes, yes, yes
    eggs: false, false, false, true
    breastfeeding: indeed, indeed, indeed, indeed

Let's identify the frequent itemsets with a support of at least 2:

    {4, hot} appears 3 times
    {4, yes} appears 3 times
    {4, indeed} appears 3 times
    {omnivore, hot} appears 2 times
    {omnivore, yes} appears 2 times
    {omnivore, indeed} appears 2 times
    {hot, yes} appears 4 times
    {hot, indeed} appears 4 times
    {yes, indeed} appears 4 times
    {false, hot} appears 3 times
    {false, yes} appears 3 times
    {false, indeed} appears 3 times

Therefore, the set of frequent itemsets with length 2 and minimal support equal to 2 is:

set_length2 = {{"4, hot"},{"4, yes"},{"4, indeed"},{"omnivore, hot"},{"omnivore, yes"},{"omnivore, indeed"},{"hot, yes"},{"hot, indeed"},{"yes, indeed"},{"false, hot"},{"false, yes"},{"false, indeed"}}

Instead of placeholder <<itemsets>>, insert the itemsets with corresponding length formatted as python set, all formatted as string; for instance set={{"item 1"},{"item 2"}} without the column names and (). Consider the first row of the CSV as the name of the columns.

To find all frequent itemsets with minimal support equal to 2 and length 5, we need to identify the combinations of five items (or attributes) that appear at least twice in the dataset.

Given the dataset:

    name: rabbit, human, fox, platypus
    legs count: 4, 2, 4, 4
    diet: herbivore, omnivore, omnivore, carnivore
    blood: hot, hot, hot, hot

Let's identify the frequent itemsets with a support of at least 2:

    {4, hot, yes, false, indeed} appears 2 times
    {omnivore, hot, yes, false, indeed} appears 2 times

Therefore, the set of frequent itemsets with length 5 and minimal support equal to 2 is:
